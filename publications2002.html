<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Seasonally-active water can be defined to include any water reservoir
that communicates with other reservoirs on time scales of a year or
shorter.  It is the interaction of these water reservoirs, under the
influence of varying solar radiation and in conjunction with surface and
atmospheric temperatures, that determines the phase-stability field for
water at the surface, and the distribution of water in various forms
below, on, and above the surface.  The atmosphere is the critical,
dynamical link in this cycling system, and also (fortunately) one of the
easiest to observe. Viking and Mars Global Surveyor observations paint a
strongly asymmetric picture of the global seasonal water cycle, tied
proximately to planetary eccentricity, and the existence of residual ice
caps of different composition at the two poles.  The northern summer
experiences the largest water vapour columns, and is associated with
sublimation from the northern residual water ice cap.  The southern
summer residual carbon dioxide ice cap is cold trap for water. 
Asymmetry in the water cycle is an unsolved problem.  Possible solutions
may involve the current timing of perihelion (the water cap resides at
the pole experiencing the longer but cooler summer), the trapping of
water ice in the northern hemisphere by tropical water ice clouds, and
the bias in the annual-average, zonal-mean atmospheric circulation
resulting from the zonal-mean difference in the elevation of the
northern and southern hemispheres. Adsorbed and frozen water have proven
harder to constrain.  Recent Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer results
suggest substantial ground ice in the mid- and high-latitudes, but this
water is likely below the seasonal skin depth for two reasons: the GRS
results are best fit with such a model, and GCM models of the water
cycle produce dramatically unrealistic atmospheric vapour distributions
when such a very near surface, GRS-like distribution is initialized -
ultimately removing the water to the northern and southern caps. Similar
climate-models of the water cycle also do not need much exchangeable
adsorbed water in order to explain the observed vapour distributions.
The possibility of liquid water is tantalizing, but difficult to
definitively judge.  On scales greater than a meter or so, Mars is most
definitely well away from the water triple point--although the surface
pressure can exceed 6.1 mbars, the partial pressure of water vapor (to
which the triple point refers) is at best orders of magnitude lower.
Several careful studies have shown, however, that locally transient
(meta-stable) liquid is possible, if the net heating of ice deposits is
high enough.  This process is aided if the total surface pressure
exceeds 6.1mbar (this prevents boiling, or the explosive loss of vapour
into the atmosphere) or if the liquid is covered by a thin ice shell,
and is only possible if surface temperatures exceed 273K (for pure
water, or the appropriate eutectic for brines) and if ice is present. 
The former challenge is much easier to meet than the latter. The melt
scenario requires that ice deposited in winter must be protected from
sublimation as surface temperatures increase in spring, but then exposed
to the peak of solar heating in summer. Available spacecraft
observations of seasonal water will be discussed with the aid of GCM
model simulations, and examined in the context of water distributions
and phases.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Mars' orbital parameters (obliquity, eccentricity and argument of
perihelion) are thought to have varied substantially on time scales
&gt;105 years.  Such variations, especially in obliquity, may
drastically affect the circulation of the atmosphere and volatile
cycling.  In this study, we focus on the response of the water and
carbon dioxide cycles to changes in these orbital parameters, chiefly
obliquity.  The study employs the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
Mars General Circulation Model, conducting simulations over a range of
orbital states to examine changes in the cycling and deposition of these
volatiles.  This model contains full 3D accounting of atmospheric water
and carbon dioxide as well as a basic dust cycle. The present martian
obliquity is 25°, though it is believed to have recently varied
between 15 and 45 degrees.  Our simulations look at present martian
conditions, only with obliquity varying between 5 and 60 degrees.
Simulations are run out until water and carbon dioxide budgets have
reached equilibrium--typically 30-40 years. As expected, volatile
cycling on Mars increases with obliquity, as the polar caps are exposed
to increased insolation, leading to greater seasonal ice caps and
ultimately development of surface water ice in the now thermally
favorible low latitudes.  By 45°, water ice is stable in a broad
band just north of the equator.  Such an ice distribution has potential
implications for the surface wind pattern through the ice-albedo effect
on surface heating.  Permanent polar CO2 caps are not stable
under present conditions, but we find CO2 cap growth and
corresponding atmospheric deflation to be evident at very low
obliquities.  We find that for most choices of orbital conditions, the
northern hemisphere remains the stable pole for water ice, a result of
the martian topographic dichotomy. We have begun to look at the impact
of desorbed CO2 and H2O ice from the regolith on
climatic conditions.  Present estimates of the volatile abundance in the
regolith vary greatly, but recent Mars Odyssey results hint at large
abundances of water ice in the martian high-latitude regolith. The
results of this study should better define models of polar volatile
evolution, specifically those of layered terrain formation. The
radiative feedback effects of increased atmospheric CO2 and
H2O from the polar caps and regoliths has yet to be examined.
Future plans include more accurate representations of dust injection and
radiative transfer to tackle this problem.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The circulation of the Martian atmosphere may be substantially affected
by changes in orbital parameters. Such changes will undoubtedly alter
the seasonal distribution of incident solar radiation on time scales
greater than 105 years, and hence the forcing of the
atmospheric circulation.  For this investigation, we focus on the
response of the general circulation to changes in obliquity,
eccentricity, and argument of perihelion.  We use the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Mars General Circulation Model (GCM) to
examine changes in the nature of the Hadley circulation, polar jets, and
eddies as orbital elements are varied. A number of basic findings emerge
from the simulations. For example, the Hadley cell exhibits strongly
non-continuous variation with obliquity.  As obliquity is increased from
0o, the northern summer circulation retains an
equinoctial-like dual cell pattern until obliquity exceeds
10o.  Only after that does the dominant cross-equatorial cell
pattern emerge.  Conversely, the southern hemisphere summer cell
develops a strong cross-equatorial pattern at obliquities below
5o.  This starkly asymmetric Hadley cell behaviour results
from the global mean topographic slope.  The simulations also highlight
other ways in which topography places a control on the extent and
strength of the Martian Hadley circulations.  The polar jet is also
affected by changes in obliquity.  For obliquities above 45o,
we find that the expanded and strengthened descending branch of the
Hadley cell adiabatically warms the polar regions, reducing the
latitudinal temperature gradient and decreasing the strength of the
corresponding polar jet.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The observed year-to-year repeatability of Martian atmospheric
temperatures and dust opacities in northern spring and summer suggests
that the seasonal cycle of Martian atmospheric dustiness cannot be
explained uniquely in terms of large (regional and global scale) dust
storms.  Instead, a steady source of atmospheric dust is needed that
generates a seasonal supply pattern that is essentially repeatable. 
Dust devils have been widely suggested to operate in this role. 
Theoretical studies  to date have mainly focused on analytical models of
dust devils as thermodynamic and dynamic systems.  In this presentation,
we discuss three-dimensional, numerical simulations of the Martian
convective boundary layer, and specifically convective vortex/dust devil
development.  The simulations are undertaken with the Mars MM5 mesoscale
atmospheric model developed at Caltech and Cornell University.  The
model is nonhydrostatic, and employs parameterizations for heat
diffusion in the Martian  subsurface, radiative heating due to dust and
carbon dioxide gas in the visible and thermal infrared, radiatively and
dynamically interactive dust, and (where applicable) the cycling of
carbon dioxide and water between the surface and atmosphere.  In these
simulations of the Martian boundary layer, the model is used with a
horizontal grid spacing of 20 to 100 m, and with a minimum of 100 points
in each direction, and over 50 levels in the vertical direction.  We
initially simulate a region near the equator, with surface properties
characteristic of the Sinus Meridiani ("Hematite") region and for  mid
southern summer.  We also show simulations for a location in the
northern tropics and with surface properties consistent  with the
Amazonis Planitia region.  These simulations are conducted near southern
spring equinox, a time when Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images suggest
development of copious, massive dust devil structures.  In all cases, we
find evidence for the development of convective, vertically aligned
vortices.  We will discuss the nature and behavior of the various
vortices developed in the simulations.

<td>We present results from an orbital survey of Martian dust devils using
the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) wide- and
narrow-angle (WA and NA) images.  The survey includes all available
imaging data (mapping and pre-mapping orbit), through to mission phase
E06.  Due to the large volume of data, we have concentrated on surveying
limited regions, selected variously on the basis of where dust devils or
other dust storm activity has previously been reported, on the basis of
where lander observations have been or will be obtained, and on the
basis of predictions from numerical atmospheric models. Our study
regions to date include: Amazonis Planitia (25-45N, 145-165W), Sinus
Meridiani (10S-10N, 10E-10W), Chryse Planitia (10-30N, 30-60W), Solis
Planum (15-45S, 75-105W), Hellas Planitia (15-60S, 265-315W), Casius
(45-65N, 255-285W), Utopia Planitia (25-45N, 225-255W), Sinai Planum
(10-20S, 60-100W), Mare Cimmerium (10-45S, 180-220W).  We have compiled
statistics on dust devil activity in three categories: dust devils
observed in NA images, dust devils observed in WA images, and dust devil
tracks observed in NA images. For each region and each category, we have
compiled statistics for four seasonal date bins, centered on the
equinoxes and solstices: Ls=45-135 (northern summer solstice),
Ls=135-225 (northern autumn equinox), Ls=225-315 (northern winter
solstice), and Ls=315-45 (northern spring equinox). Our survey has
highlighted great spatial variability in dust devil activity, with the
Amazonis Planitia region being by far the dominant location for
activity.  This region is additionally characterized by a large size
range of dust devils, including individual devils up to several km in
height.  Other regions in which dust devils have been frequently imaged
include Utopia, Solis, and Sinai.  Numerous dust devil tracks were
observed in Casius and Cimmerium, but with very few accompanying dust
devils.  This suggests dust devils occurring in local times other than
that of the MGS orbit (~2pm). Our seasonal statistics suggest a very
strong preference for Amazonis and Solis dust devil activity to occur in
the northern autumn season.  Conversely, Utopia shows dust devil
activity which is relatively constant, except in the northern spring
period. The observations will be presented, and compared with numerical
model predictions.  Initial results from this survey have already been
used to define target regions for very high resolution simulations of
dust devil development using the Caltech/Cornell Mars MM5 model.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Simplified models of planetary climate require a parameterization for
the equator-to-pole transport of heat and its dependence on factors,
including the planetary rotation rate.  Various such parameterizations
exist, including ones based on the theory of baroclinic eddy mixing, and
on principles of global entropy generation.  However, such
parameterizations are difficult to test given the limited available
observational opportunities.  In this study, we use a numerical model to
examine heat flux dependencies, as part of a wider study of circulation
regime sensitivity to rotation rates and other parameters. This study
makes use of a simplified version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory (GFDL) "Skyhi" General Circulation Model (GCM).  All
terrestrial hydrological processes have been stripped from the model,
which in the form used here, is adapted from the Martian version of
Skyhi.  The atmosphere has the gas properties of CO2, except
that it has been made uncondensible.  No aerosols or surface ices are
allowed.  The model surface is flat, and of uniform albedo and thermal
inertia.  For the simulations presented in this study, the diurnal,
seasonal, and eccentricity cycles have been disabled ({ i.e.} the
surface and atmosphere receives constant, daily- and seasonally-averaged
incident solar radiation). Radiative heating is treated with a band
model for CO2 gas in the thermal and near-infrared bands. The
use of a complex model to examine simplified theory of heat transport
requires some justification since it is not necessarily clear that these
models (GCM's) provide an accurate emulation of the real atmosphere (of
any given planet).  In this study, we have intentionally removed those
aspects of GCM's that are of greatest concern.  Especially for
terrestrial GCM's, the hydrologic cycle is a major source of uncertainty
due to radiative feedbacks, and cloud coupling to small-scale,
convective mixing.  For other planets, aerosols are important as
radiatively and dynamical active species.  Yet an additional cause of
error, especially when testing global entropy principles, is the
condensation of the atmosphere (as in  the case of Mars).  We have
eliminated all of these concerns in the pure, non-condensible gas
atmosphere of our simplified model.  Our results will be compared with 
those of simplified theoretical predictions, and differences discussed.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The meteorology of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) candidate landing
sites is of importance because of the constraint it provides on the
likely ability of the rovers to successfully land and operate.  The
meteorology may also be of interest insofar as the landscapes to be
traversed and studied by the rovers may be influenced to a greater or
lesser degree by aeolian activity.  In support of the MER Program, we
have conducted studies of several of the candidate landing sites using
the Mars Mesoscale Model developed at Caltech and Cornell University as
an adaptation of the terrestrial PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5).  The
sites studied include Meridiani (``Hematite"), Gusev, and Mellas.  The
model results suggest that winds associated with convection and/or
topography may be of concern at each of the landing sites.  The
relatively flat Hematite site is simulated to develop strong, deep
convection.  At highest resolution (few hundred meters), the convection
is predicted to be cellular with significant up- and down-drafts. The
local time of landing for both MER rovers is during the period of most
active convection at all sites.  Gusev and Mellas show varying degrees
of topographic influence on winds.  At Gusev, the crater walls provide
strong foci for upslope-downslope circulations, while the walls and
other nearby topography provide ``anchor" points for the initiation
(initial upwelling) of convection during the day.  Mellas provides a
case example  of strongly channelized flow.  Convection is less of a
concern at Mellas, but is replaced by diurnally reversing up-canyon and
down-canyon flow.  The flow patterns are also strongly influenced by the
effects of canyon wall heating by solar radiation. In summary, the thin
Martian atmosphere responds strongly to slope heating by developing
slope winds which provide  a challenge to missions seeking to closely
approach ``interesting" terrain.  Equally a problem for the MER mission,
for flat  landing sites, is the use of an early afternoon local time of
landing, coinciding with the peak of boundary layer convection.

<td>Surfaces containing features known as slope streaks are common on Mars
in regions where thermal-inertia is low and steep slopes are frequent.
We have recently compiled a catalog of slope streak images and
identified previously unrecognized correlations with surface properties.
Building on this work, we analyze data from Mars Orbiter Camera, from
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, and from the Thermal Emission Imaging
System instrument on board Mars Odyssey, to constrain the physical
properties and thermal conditions at the specific sites where slope
streaks are forming.  A number of proposed theories explaining the
formation mechanism of slope streaks can be tested using new data,
including an exciting possibility of the potential role of a water

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) is continuing the infrared
global monitoring of Martian dust and water ice aerosols as well as
atmospheric temperatures started by the Mariner 9 Infrared
Interferometric Spectrometer (IRIS), Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper
(IRTM), and the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer
(TES) instruments.  Aerosol optical depth is retrieved in a manner
similar to retrieval algorithms used with TES data.  THEMIS 9 point
spectra are converted to the equivalent column integrated optical depth.
The relative contributions of dust and water ice to the observed
optical depth are then determined using a least squares fit of
predetermined water ice and dust opacity spectral shapes to the measured
THEMIS optical depth.  Several refinements have been made to the aerosol
opacity retrieval algorithms for increased accuracy of both aerosol
abundances as well as surface temperatures.  The opacity retrieval
algorithm iteratively solves for a self-consistent solution for surface
temperature as well as aerosol abundance.  As a result, no atmospheric
transparency wavelength needs to be assumed.  Surface emissivity maps
are also now incorporated into the retrieval algorithm.  Results to date
are consistent with concurrent TES observations, displaying low dust
opacities and the onset of the perihelion water ice cloud belt as Mars
progresses towards northern summer.  The Mars Odyssey mission plan
includes observations that drift from local times of approximately 3-6
PM.  These local times combined with concurrent TES observations of a
local time of 2 PM will allow for some resolution of diurnal atmospheric
variations, such as water ice cloud abundances.  The THEMIS
investigation will extend the continuous infrared monitoring of the
Martian atmosphere, bridging the MGS TES and the 2005 Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) investigations. 
This continuous long-term monitoring is essential for the understanding
of the atmospheric processes and cycles present in the Martian
atmosphere.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present the first comprehensive general circulation model study of
water ice condensation and cloud formation in the Martian atmosphere. We
focus on the effects of condensation in limiting the vertical
distribution and transport of water and on the importance of
condensation for the generation of the observed Martian water cycle. We
do not treat cloud ice radiative effects, ice sedimentation rates are
prescribed, and we do not treat interactions between dust and cloud ice.
The model generates cloud in a manner consistent with earlier
one-dimensional (1-D) model results, typically evolving a uniform
(constant mass mixing ratio) vertical distribution of vapor, which is
capped by cloud at the level where the condensation point temperature is
reached. Because of this vertical distribution of water, the Martian
atmosphere is generally very far from fully saturated, in contrast to
suggestions based upon interpretation of Viking data. This discrepancy
results from inaccurate representation of the diurnal cycle of air
temperatures in the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data. In fact,
the model suggests that only the northern polar atmosphere in summer is
consistently near its column-integrated holding capacity. In this case,
the column amount is determined primarily by the temperature of the
northern polar ice cap. Comparison of the water cycle generated by the
model with and without atmospheric ice condensation and precipitation
shows two major roles for water ice cloud. First, clouds are essential
to the observed rapid return of atmospheric water to the surface in late
northern summer, as ice sedimentation forces the water column to shrink
in response to the downward motion of the condensation level,
concentrating water near surface sinks. Second, ice sedimentation limits
the amount of water that is transported between the hemispheres through
the Hadley circulation. This latter effect is used to greatly improve
the model simulation of the annual water cycle by increasing ice
sedimentation rates. The model is thus shown to be able to reasonably
reproduce the annual cycles of vapor and ice cloud as compared to Viking
data. In addition, the model is shown able to reproduce
near-instantaneous maps of water ice derived from Hubble Space Telescope
images. The seasonal evolution of the geographic distribution of water
ice compares reasonably well with Viking and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) observations, except in the
prediction of a weak tropical cloud belt in southern summer. Finally, it
is shown that the tropical cloud belt is generated in the model by the
cooling of water vapor entrained in the upwelling branch of the Hadley
cell. Decline of the tropical cloud belt in mid northern summer is shown
to be related to an increase in air temperatures, rather than to
decreases in water vapor supply or the vigor of Hadley cell ascent. By
equinox, the cloud belt experiences a second major decline event, this
time due to a reduction in vapor supply. The ability of the model to
emulate many aspects of observed cloud behavior is encouraging, as is
the ability of enhanced ice sedimentation to improve the overall quality
of the water cycle simulation. However, significant work remains to be
done before all observational constraints can be matched simultaneously.
Specifically, in order for the generally good fit to all other data to
be attained, cloud ice particle sizes about an order of magnitude too
large must be used.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Martian dust storm provides one of the most spectacular examples of
transient meteorological phenomena in the solar system. While most
Martian dust lifting events are local in scale, tens to hundreds of
kilometers, some are regional storms thousands of kilometers in size,
and a few have been observed to initiate global dust storms that shroud
the entire planet. Large dust storms represent the most dramatic
component of the Martian dust cycle - one of the three main cycles
determining the climate on Mars. They can generate significant
perturbations of the global climate, increasing mid-level air
temperatures by tens of degrees Kelvin. These storms can be categorized
as major storms. Observations before Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) indicate
that classical major dust storms originate in the southern hemisphere
during the "dust storm season" of southern spring and summer
(Ls=180-360). It was suspected that the dynamics of major dust storms
involve feedback between the atmospheric circulation and radiative
heating of lofted dust. However, there has been little success in
providing mechanisms to explain the origin and/or transience of major
storms. Recently, a new category of major dust storm has been
identified, with dust lifting initially associated with
northern-hemisphere fronts, and involving flushing of dust from the
northern to southern hemisphere. Such "flushing" dust storms are mainly
observed in mid northern fall and mid northern winter. We present a
mechanism for the development of these storms, including natural
explanations for diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability of the
storms. Dust flushing from the northern hemisphere requires coherence
and cooperation between three major dynamical systems: baroclinic
storms, thermal tides, and the Hadley circulation. Once dust is flushed
into the southern hemisphere, accumulation of dust in the Hadley
convergence zone will greatly increase the strength of the circulation,
leading to major dust storm. These results provide not only a coherent
picture of major storm development and transience, but also an example
of cooperative interaction of Mars' major dynamical systems over
planetary length-scales.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Comprehensive inter-comparison of thermal infrared data collected by
Mariner 9, Viking, and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) is presented, with a
specific focus on air temperatures, dust opacities, and water ice
opacities. Emphasis is placed upon creating a uniform data set so as to
most effectively reduce inter-instrument biases and offsets. We show
that the globally-averaged martian atmosphere executes an exceedingly
repeatable annual cycle of air temperature, closing in northern spring
and summer to within a Kelvin. The annual cycle shows a strong asymmetry
about the equinoxes, with northern summer showing relatively low
temperatures and essentially no short-term (tens of days) variability.
Viking and MGS air temperatures are essentially indistinguishable,
suggesting that the Viking and MGS eras are characterized by exactly the
same climatic state. Southern summer is characterized by strong dust
storm activity, and we note that the period around Ls=225 is
characterized by very high dust opacities associated with dust storm
development or decay in every year thus far observed by spacecraft. Dust
opacity shows a highly repeatable annual cycle, closing to essentially
the same values each year in northern spring and summer, with Viking and
MGS opacities being very similar. We show that both Viking and MGS data
sets show significant (and similar) polar cap edge dust storm activity.
The origins of the various major dust storms can be identified in the
thermal infrared data from Viking and MGS, including the "flushing" of
dust from the northern autumn baroclinic zone into the southern
hemisphere tropics, which has also been identified in visible imaging.
Water ice opacities have been retrieved from Viking infrared data for
the first time. We show that the cloud belt structure and evolution is
essentially the same in each of the multiple years observed by Viking
and MGS. Relatively subtle spatial features recur in the cloud belt from
year-to-year, suggesting the influence of surface topography and
thermophysical properties, and consistent supply of water vapor. The
seasonal evolution of the tropical cloud belt through northern spring
and summer is shown, with the only significant deviations between years
occurring from Ls=140-160, where opacities fall in the second MGS year
associated with a small dust storm. Polar hood clouds are observed in
the Viking and MGS observations with similar timing and extent. It would
seem that the martian atmosphere executes a very repeatable annual cycle
of atmospheric phenomena, with the only significant exception being the
occurrence of major dust events. After such dust events, the atmosphere
rapidly relaxes to its stable, repeatable state.

<td>With the successful entry of the Mars Odyssey spacecraft into mapping
orbit in early 2002 (Ls=330), the Thermal Emission Imaging System
(THEMIS) joins Mars Global Surveyor TES in monitoring Martian
atmospheric temperatures and aerosol opacity using thermal infrared
remote sensing from Mars orbit. The THEMIS 15-micron channel (Band 10)
can be used in the same way as the Viking IRTM 15-micron channel to give
temperatures integrated over a broad portion of the atmosphere centered
at about 0.6 mbar. The characteristic signatures of dust and water ice
aerosols that are clearly evident in the other THEMIS channels can be
used to estimate atmospheric opacity. Here, we give an overview of the
latest atmospheric results from both THEMIS and TES during the northern
winter and spring seasons (Ls=270-90). Included during this period were
the decay of the 2001a planet-encircling dust storm, the growth and
establishment of the low-latitude aphelion water-ice cloud belt, and the
annual globally-averaged minima of water vapor, dust, and atmospheric
temperature.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The planet Venus is our most Earth-like neighbor in size, mass, and
distance from the sun. In spite of these similarities, and the intense
scrutiny that it received early in the space age, the Venus surface and
atmosphere are characterized by some of the most enigmatic features seen
anywhere in the solar system. A reinvigorated Venus exploration program
is essential to the development of a comprehensive understanding of the
origin and evolution of Earth-like terrestrial planets. The present NASA
inner planets strategy, which focuses exclusively on Mars, will provide
an incomplete, and possibly misleading description of processes that
produce these objects. If Venus-like terrestrial planets are common,
this approach will also impede efforts to interpret observations of
extrasolar terrestrial planets, which are expected to become available
by the end of the decade. Here, we propose a Venus exploration program
that has been designed to explain the origin and divergent evolution of
the interiors, surfaces, and atmospheres of the terrestrial planets in
our solar system, and provide greater insight into the conditions that
may affect the habitability of terrestrial planets in other solar
systems.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Surface wind stresses and dust lifting in the south polar region of Mars
are examined with a three-dimensional numerical model. The focus of this
study is the middle to late southern spring period when cap-edge dust
lifting events are observed. Mesoscale model simulations of high
southern latitudes are conducted at three dates within this season
(Ls = 225°, 255°, and 310°). Assuming that dust
injection is related to the saltation of sand-sized grains or
aggregates, the Mars MM5 mesoscale model predicts surface wind stresses
of sufficient strength to initiate movement of sand-sized particles
(~100 μm), and hence dust lifting, during all three periods. The
availability of dust and/or sand-sized particles is not addressed within
this study. Instead, the degree to which the existence of sufficiently
strong winds limit dust injection is examined. By eliminating forcing
elements from the model, the important dynamical modes generating high
wind stresses are isolated. The direct cap-edge thermal contrast (and
topographic slopes in some locations) provides the primary drive for
high surface wind stresses at the cap edge, while sublimation flow is
not found to be particularly important, at these three dates.
Simulations in which dust is injected into the lowest model layer when
wind stresses exceed a threshold show similar patterns of atmospheric
dust to those seen in recent observations. Comparison between these
simulations and those without active dust injection shows no signs of
consistent positive or negative feedback due to dust clouds on the
surface wind stress fields during the late spring season examined here.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmosphere
Research Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5) has been converted for use on
Mars. Modifications are based on schemes implemented in the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mars General Circulation Model (GCM).
Validation of the Mars MM5 is conducted by comparison to the Mars GCM,
examining the large-scale dynamics in the two models. Agreement between
the two models on similar scales (a few hundred kilometers) is good.
Validation is also performed against both Viking Landers and Mars
Pathfinder meteorological observations with the model run at higher
vertical (lowest level at 1.6 m) and horizontal resolution (a few
kilometers). We find reasonable agreement with near-surface air
temperature, pressure, and wind direction observations, with caveats.
The results demonstrate that the model accurately simulates surface heat
balance and the propagation of global thermal tides. However, wind
speeds are underpredicted. The model generates the correct phasing of
wind speeds with local time at the Viking Lander 2 site during winter
but does not generate the correct phasing at the other sites or seasons.
We examined the importance of slopes and global tides in generating the
diurnal cycle of winds at the lander sites. We find that tides are at
least as important as slopes, in contrast to previous studies. This
study suggests that when used in combination with a GCM, the Mars MM5
promises to be a powerful tool for the investigation of processes
central to the Martian climate on scales from hundreds of kilometers to
tens of meters.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We describe the first use of a general circulation model to study the
Martian water cycle. Water is treated as a passive tracer, except for
ice-albedo coupling. The model is used to assess which mechanisms and
water reservoirs are critical to the seasonal evolution of water and
specifically the attainment of an interannually repeatable steady state.
The model comes to a reasonable steady state with active surface ice and
atmospheric vapor and ice reservoirs. A regolith is not necessary. The
mechanism of equilibration results from independent parameters
controlling the transport of water between the northern polar and the
extratropical atmospheres at different seasons. Water export from the
northern summer pole results from weak mixing across a strong vapor
gradient, dependent upon northern cap temperatures. Import at other
seasons depends on stronger mixing and weak vapor gradients, which are
history dependent. Equilibration is achieved when the fluxes balance,
minus a small net loss to the south. We find that with a southern
residual CO2 cap, the water cycle cannot be completely
closed. We conclude that the northern summer cap temperature determines
the bulk humidity of the atmosphere, all else being equal. We proceed to
show that a water cap exposed in southern summer would be unstable with
respect to the north for dynamical as well as thermal reasons. At high
obliquity (45°), much higher vapor abundances result in more
widespread surface ice with seasonal ice caps overlapping in the
equinoctial subtropics, producing year-round stability of water ice just
north of the equator.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Large seasonal and hemispheric asymmetries in the martian climate system
are generally ascribed to variations in solar heating associated with
orbital eccentricity. As the orbital elements slowly change (over a
period of &gt;104 years), characteristics of the climate such
as dustiness and the vigour of atmospheric circulation are thought to
vary, as should asymmetries in the climate (for example, the deposition
of water ice at the northern versus the southern pole). Such orbitally
driven climate change might be responsible for the observed layering in
Mars' polar deposits by modulating deposition of dust and water ice.
Most current theories assume that climate asymmetries completely reverse
as the angular distance between equinox and perihelion changes by
180°. Here we describe a major climate mechanism that will not
precess in this way. We show that Mars' global north-south elevation
difference forces a dominant southern summer Hadley circulation that is
independent of perihelion timing. The Hadley circulation, a tropical
overturning cell responsible for trade winds, largely controls
interhemispheric transport of water and the bulk dustiness of the
atmosphere. The topography therefore imprints a strong handedness on
climate, with water ice and the active formation of polar layered
deposits more likely in the north.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The water cycle is one of the most important mechanisms shaping the
current climate of Mars. Recent progress in climate monitoring with the
Mars Global Surveyor's TES instrument has revealed new features of the
water cycle, including its strong coupling with the atmospheric
circulation. We have implemented comprehensive simulation of
hydrological processes in the GFDL Mars General Circulation Model,
including at- mospheric transport and microphysics of water ice clouds
and their coupling with dust and radiative balance. It is shown that the
seasonal migration of water between polar regions and tropics is
strongly influenced by the microphysical properties of clouds and the
Hadley cell circulation. The intensity and zonal structure of this
circulation is, in turn, sensitive to radiative forcing by aerosols. In
order to determine how various mechanisms influence the water cycle, we
present sensitivity studies against dust load- ing and microphysical
processes in clouds. Multiannual simulations with a reduced
self-consistent microphysical scheme have been carried out to address
the stability of the current surface water inventory and the origin of
its prominent interhemispherical asymmetry.
