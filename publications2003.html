<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We investigate the triggering, growth, decay and the inter-annual
variability of global dust storms (GDS) on Mars. To date, testing of
various theories of GDS initiation and variability has been limited by
inability to numerically simulate spontaneous, variable storm
development from realistic pre-storm model states. Here we describe
General Circulation Model simulations that generate spontaneous and
variable GDSs from realistic background conditions. Modelled GDSs
produce dramatic increases in atmospheric dustiness, global-mean air
temperatures, and atmospheric circulation, in accord with observations.
The simulations generate global storms in southern spring and summer
with significant inter-annual variability in size and timing of
occurrence, including years with no storms. We propose a simple
explanation for the observed dust cycle on Mars from our simulations.
Stresses associated with large-scale (&gt;300 km) wind systems initiate
the large storms. Explosive growth results from the intensification of
the Hadley circulation and the activation of secondary dust lifting
centers. Away from great storms, the annually repeatable cycle of
atmospheric temperatures and dust opacities observed in northern spring
and summer is a result of convective (dust devil) lifting.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The work of the wind is the one sedimentary process that both acts on
the surface and interacts with the lower atmosphere of Mars.
Wind-sculpted landforms such as sand dunes are among the few features
visible in spacecraft images that provide information on the aeolian
sedimentary environment and surface wind circulation patterns of Mars.
The study of the placement and orientations of sand dunes leads to the
depositional, erosional, and transport history of sand across a region.
When correlated with wind predictions from an atmospheric model, dune
orientations provide not only model verification but also an
understanding of the seasonal weather patterns that influence dune
morphology. We have applied a mesoscale model to Noachis Terra, an 1800
km x 3500 km area of Mars containing several dune fields. The Mars
Mesoscale Model 5 (Mars MM5), developed from the PSU/NCAR MM5, was run
in periods spanning the Martian year, predicting seasonal wind patterns
for each of nine dune fields in Noachis Terra. Dune slipface
orientations were measured for all dune fields imaged by the Mars
Orbiter Camera (MOC) on the Mars Global Surveyor. Preliminary results
indicate a high correspondence of dune morphology with present-day
seasonally-dependent wind patterns predicted by the Mars MM5.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The placement of water within the martian regolith may occur through any
of several means, the most important of which appear to be vapor
diffusion, surface adsorption and subaerial deposition.  In order to
understand the relative importance of  each of these modes during past
periods of higher obliquity, we have linked a vapor and thermal
diffusion model to the GFDL Mars GCM, and permitted water (as ice, vapor
or adsorbate) to interact freely between the atmosphere and regolith.
Our results strive to explain both the unique latitude-dependent terrain
found in the mid-latitudes of Mars and existence of the expansive
subsurface ice reservoirs discovered by Odyssey GRS data.  Results from
the Odyssey GRS instrument indicate ice abundances poleward of
60o (up to 90% by volume) vastly greater than one would
expect based upon simple diffusion and the assumed porosity (40%) of the
regolith.  This disparity led to our initial investigation into
subaerial deposition and subsequent sublimation as a means of inserting
ice within the regolith.  Our most recent work continues this
investigation, and permits us to explore the importance of surface
adsorption and diffusion of atmospheric vapor as well.  Earlier results
from the GFDL MGCM have suggested that at high obliquity, ice is not
homogeneously distributed across the surface within the latitude band
having the coldest annual mean temperatures.  Rather, water is
preferentially deposited as localized ice ``sheets'' in regions of high
thermal inertia and/or high topography.  Such findings neglected the
thermal inertia feedback of surface ice, which will permit ice to be
retained more uniformly within this latitude band.  This ice/thermal
inertia feedback has been included in our present work.  Lastly, we have
performed both 1-D and 3-D simulations of the regolith-atmosphere
interaction to determine the efficacy of the deposition-sublimation,
obliquity-dependent layering mechanism for a full obliquity cycle (
˜100,000 years).

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The unprecedented spatial resolution of the Mars Odyssey Thermal
Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) is used to infer and compare the
optical and thermal infrared properties of martian high-latitude and
polar surfaces. Materials of interest include the north polar layered
deposits (NPLD), the dark, dune-forming material associated with the
north polar cap complex,  and the ground ice-rich, latitude-dependent
layer (the landing site of the Phoenix Scout mission). To address these
goals, we have targeted and acquired THEMIS data as part of the Mars
Odyssey Participating Scientist program. We use these THEMIS data in
order to understand the morphology and color/thermal properties of the
NPLD over relevant (i.e., m to km) spatial scales. We have assembled
color mosaics of the data in order to map the distribution of ices, the
different layered units, dark material, and underlying basement. The
color information from THEMIS is crucial for distiguis-ing these
different units, which are less distinct on Mars Orbiter Camera images.
In the NPLD, we wish to understand the nature of the marginal scarps and
their relationship to the dark material. Co-registered Mars Orbiter
Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data provide a measure of scarp morphologies and
may help identify the process(es) eroding the NPLD (e.g., mass wast-ing,
wind, sublimation). The dark material (or perhaps a darker layered unit
in  planar configuration) is present at the feet of many scarps, but
expresses dune bedforms only tens of kilometers away from the scarps.
MOLA will help identify the relationship between the spatial
distribution of dark material, the presence of bedforms, and the
influence of topography. We have derived the thermophysical properties
of the different materials using THEMIS and Mars Global Surveyor Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (TES) data, also resulting in a new map of the
thermal inertia of Mars' northern hemisphere. Such analyses are
complicated by the need for atmospheric correction (of both radiatively
active CO2 and dust) and accurate surface temperatures. In order to
derive thermal inertias and thermally derived albedos, we employ a 1-D,
radiative-convective thermal model of Mars surface, subsurface and
atmosphere. The model uses simultaneous (or seasonally relevant) TES
atmospheric dust opacities. We also are studying the effects of surface
slopes on insolation using MOLA topographic data.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>THEMIS offers a unique opportunity to examine mesoscale atmospheric
features on Mars in the visible and infrared. The high spatial
resolution (˜100 meter per pixel) of the system comes at the cost
of imaging spatial coverage, requiring atmospheric features to be
targeted. Over the course of the past year, we have been targeting areas
and features identified in MOC WA imaging as part of a THEMIS
``atmospheric campaign."  These features include topographic cloud
systems, polar hood clouds, convective clouds, local dust storms in
Hellas and along the retreating edge of the southern seasonal ice cap,
and dust fronts in the northern high latitudes.  Typically 2-3 band
color images and 3-10 band infrared images have been acquired, both with
roughly 100 meters per pixel.  We will describe the targeting and its
rationale, show initial results from the campaign, and provide some
interpretation of observed features.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The discovery by Mars Odyssey of large deposits of subsurface ice in
regions where surface ice is no longer stable has raised questions about
putative past climatic conditions under different orbital states.  We
have used the GFDL Mars General Circulation Model (MGCM) as a tool for
examining these questions, and suggest that these deposits may be
quasi-stable permafrost remnants from an earlier period of high
obliquity, covered by a sublimation lag deposit formed when the mean
annual temperature exceeded the local frost point temperature.  We have
incorporated a thermal and vapor diffusion code into our GCM to simulate
the behavior of water in the regolith and the processes that move water
from the atmosphere to the surface and back.  Water in the regolith may
exist as vapor, ice or adsorbate, in relative abundances dependent upon
the soil  temperature and ambient pressure.  The model results show the
effectiveness of ice as a means to reduce the local thermal inertia,
thereby reducing annual maximum temperatures and increasing the
probability that surface ice deposits of a given thickness will survive
throughout the warmer summer, and hence build, essentially, a permafrost
layer over obliquity timescales.  The development of an ice sheet
beneath a sublimation lag appears similar to glacial remnants found in
the Antarctic Dry Valleys beneath tens of centimeters of sublimation
till.  On Earth, these deposits have existed, largely unchanged, for
millions of years.  On Mars, we suggest that these mid-latitude deposits
are several hundred thousand years old, at most-the remnant deposits of
the past few martian obliquity cycles.  The development of a sublimation
lag of a few tens of centimeters  seems to be enough to retain ice in
these regions until the next high obliquity period.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A descriptive study of the near-surface meteorology at three of the
potential Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites (Terra Meridiani,
Gusev Crater, and Melas Chasma) is presented using global and mesoscale
models. The mesoscale model provides a detailed picture of meteorology
on scales down to a few kilometers but is not well constrained by
observations away from the Viking and Pathfinder landing sites. As such,
care must be taken in the interpretation of the results, with there
being high confidence that the types of circulations predicted will
indeed occur and somewhat less in the quantitative precision of the
predictions and the local-time phasing of predicted circulations. All
three landing sites are in the tropics and are affected by Hadley
circulation, by diurnal variations due to the global thermal tide, and
by planetary scale topography (in these particular cases from Tharsis,
Elysium, and the global topographic dichotomy boundary). Terra Meridiani
is least affected by large variations in local topography. Mean winds at
Terra Meridiani during MER landing would be less than 10 m/s with little
vertical shear. However, these low wind speeds result from strong mixing
in the early afternoon convective boundary layer, which creates its own
hazard in the horizontal variation of vertical winds of up to 8 m/s
(both upward and downward). In Gusev Crater the topography of Ma'adim
Vallis and the crater rim generates strong diurnally reversing
channeling of wind in Ma'adim Vallis and diurnally reversing radial flow
in the crater associated with thermal slope winds on the crater rim. The
overturning circulation in Gusev Crater slightly suppresses the daytime
convective boundary layer. Melas Chasma in Valles Marineris provides an
example of strong topographic forcing of near-surface circulation. Of
particular interest is the channeling of regional scale wind toward the
center of the Tharsis plateau during the evening. This results in a
surface level jet along the canyon of over 25 m/s. Drainage of air from
the plateau and into the canyon produces vertical winds down the canyon
walls in the evening of over 5 m/s. In contrast, during the early
afternoon (MER landing time), horizontal winds at the proposed MER
landing site are relatively calm, with little mean shear with height.
This results from the proposed site being in a region of local
divergence and the action of daytime convection. The nature of flow in
Melas Chasma results in an interesting dual maximum in boundary
convection and depth, with the usual daytime afternoon free convective
maximum being joined by a mechanically forced nighttime boundary layer
of almost 2 km depth.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Each Mars Exploration Rover (MER) is sensitive to the Martian winds
encountered near the surface during the entry, descent, and landing
(EDL) process. These winds are strongly influenced by local (mesoscale)
conditions. In the absence of suitable wind observations, wind fields
predicted by Martian mesoscale atmospheric models have been analyzed to
guide landing site selection. In order to encompass the available models
and render them useful to the EDL engineering team, a series of
statistical techniques was applied to the model results. These analyses
cover the high-priority landing sites during the expected landing times
(1200-1500 LT). The number of sites studied is limited by the
computational and analysis cost of the mesoscale models. The statistical
measures concentrate on the effective mean wind (the wind as seen by the
landing system) and on the vertical structure of the horizontal winds.
Both aspects are potentially hazardous to the MER landing system. In
addition, a number of individual wind profiles from the mesoscale model
were processed into a form that can be used directly by the EDL Monte
Carlo simulations. The statistical analysis indicates that the Meridiani
Planum and Elysium landing sites are probably safe. The Gusev Crater and
Isidis Basin sites may be safe, but further analysis by the EDL
engineers will be necessary to quantify the actual risk. Finally, the
winds at the Melas Chasma landing site (and presumably other Valles
Marineris landing sites) are dangerous. While the statistical parameters
selected for these studies were primarily of engineering and safety
interest, the techniques are potentially useful for more general
scientific analyses. One interesting result of the current analysis is
that the depth of the convective boundary layer (and thus the resulting
energy density) appears to be primarily driven by the existence of a
well-organized mesoscale (or regional) circulation, primarily driven by
large-scale topographic features at Mars.

<td>The Mars Odyssey spacecraft entered into Martian orbit in October 2001
and after successful aerobraking, began mapping in February 2002.
Thermal infrared images taken by the Thermal Emission Imaging System
(THEMIS) on board the Odyssey spacecraft allow for the quantitative
retrieval of atmospheric dust and water ice aerosol optical depth. Data
collected so far cover late northern winter, spring, and summer
(Ls = 330°-160°). During this period, THEMIS observed
the decay of a regional dust storm, a number of local dust storms along
the edge of the retreating north polar cap, and the growth of the
low-latitude aphelion water ice cloud belt. Data from THEMIS complements
the concurrent Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES)
data by sampling a later local time (~1400 LT for TES versus ~1600-1730
LT for THEMIS) and by observing at much higher spatial resolution.
Comparison of water ice optical depth in the aphelion cloud belt from
THEMIS and TES shows a significantly higher optical depth in the late
afternoon (THEMIS) than in the early afternoon (TES).

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Intercomparison of thermal infrared data collected by Mariner 9, Viking,
and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) is presented with a specific focus on air
temperatures, dust opacities, and water ice opacities. Emphasis is
placed on creating a uniform data set to most effectively reduce
interinstrument biases and offsets. The annual cycle consistently shows
a strong asymmetry about the equinoxes, with northern spring and summer
exhibiting relatively low temperatures, very high year-to-year
repeatability, and essentially no short-term (tens of days) variability.
The globally averaged Martian nighttime air temperatures close annually
to within a Kelvin during northern spring and summer. Daytime
temperatures show more variability (3-6 K). The difference in
repeatability of daytime versus nighttime temperatures is not
understood. Viking and MGS air temperatures are essentially
indistinguishable for this period, suggesting that the Viking and MGS
eras are characterized by essentially the same climatic state. Southern
summer is characterized by strong dust storm activity and hence strong
year-to-year air temperature variability. Dust opacity shows a
remarkable degree of interannual variability in southern spring and
summer, associated with the intermittent activity of regional and
planet-encircling dust storms, but exhibits high year-to-year
repeatability in northern spring and summer. Specifically, late northern
spring and early northern summer dust opacities appear to be completely
insensitive to the occurrence (or not) of major dust storms in the
previous southern spring or summer. We show that both Viking and MGS
data sets exhibit significant (and similar) polar cap edge dust storm
activity. The origins of the various major dust storms can be identified
in the thermal infrared data from Viking and MGS, including the
transport of dust from the northern autumn baroclinic zone into the
southern hemisphere tropics, which has also been identified in visible
imaging. We also note that the period around Ls = 225° is
characterized by very high dust opacities associated with dust storm
development or decay in every year thus far observed by spacecraft.
Water ice opacities have been retrieved from Viking infrared data for
the first time. We show that the northern spring and summer tropical
cloud belt structure and evolution are essentially the same in each of
the multiple years observed by Viking and MGS. Relatively subtle spatial
features recur in the cloud belt from year to year, suggesting the
influence of surface topography and thermophysical properties and a
reasonably consistent supply of water vapor. The seasonal evolution of
the tropical cloud belt through northern spring and summer is shown,
with the only significant deviations between years occurring from
Ls = 140° to 160°, where opacities fall in the second
MGS year associated with a small dust storm. Polar hood clouds are
observed in Viking and MGS observations with similar timing and extent.
Interactions between dust and water ice were highlighted in the Hellas
basin region during the southern spring 1977a and 2001 dust storms. The
observations demonstrate that the Martian atmosphere executes a very
``repeatable'' annual cycle of atmospheric phenomena. However, a major
part of this cycle is the occurrence of highly variable and potentially
major dust storm events. After such dust storm events the atmosphere
rapidly relaxes to its stable, repeatable state.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In this paper we define and describe morphological features that have
colloquially been termed ``spiders'' and map their distribution in the
south polar region of Mars. We show that these features go through a
distinct seasonal evolution, exhibiting dark plumes and associated
fan-shaped deposits during the local defrosting of the seasonal cap. We
have documented the seasonal evolution of the cryptic region and have
found that spiders only occur within this terrain. These observations
are consistent with a geyser-like model for spider formation.
Association with the transparent (cryptic) portion of the seasonal cap
is consistent with basal sublimation and the resulting venting of
CO2 gas. Also consistent with such venting is the observation
of dark fan-shaped deposits apparently emanating from spider centers.
Spiders are additionally confined to the polar layered deposits
presumably due to the poorly consolidated and easily eroded nature of
their upper surface.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>An analysis of daily-to-interannual variability in the surface pressure
field of the Martian nothern hemisphere as given by a Martian climate
model is presented. In an empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
decomposition, the dominant first two modes of variability comprise a
zonal wavenumber 1 feature centered at 70 N latitude moving eastward
with a period of 6 to 8 sols. This feature is a baroclinic wave and
accounts for 53% of the northern hemisphere non-stationary surface
pressure variability, and, when active, has an amplitude of up to 2% of
local surface pressure. The third mode of the EOF decomposition is
annular about the Martian north pole, is null southward of 70 N, and
accounts for 7% of the northern hemisphere non-stationary surface
pressure variability. The baroclinic wave (EOFs 1 &amp; 2) is active
during northern hemisphere winter and spring, consistent with models of
the Martian atmospheric circulation, and the annular mode (EOF 3) is
active only at the onset and demise of the baroclinic feature. When
active, it is not uncommon for the annular mode to reside in either its
positive or negative state stably for 20 to 30 sols. It is postulated
that baroclinic waves with longitudinal wavenumber 2, 3, and 4 act as a
pump for the annular mode. The annular mode should not be present in MGS
TES data.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on Mars Odyssey has
produced infrared to visible wavelength images of the martian surface
that show lithologically distinct layers with variable thickness,
implying temporal changes in the processes or environments during or
after their formation. Kilometer-scale exposures of bedrock are
observed; elsewhere airfall dust completely mantles the surface over
thousands of square kilometers. Mars has compositional variations at
100-meter scales, for example, an exposure of olivine-rich basalt in the
walls of Ganges Chasma. Thermally distinct ejecta facies occur around
some craters with variations associated with crater age. Polar
observations have identified temporal patches of water frost in the
north polar cap. No thermal signatures associated with endogenic heat
sources have been identified.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Variations in the Martian water and CO2 cycles with changes
in orbital and rotational parameters are examined using the Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mars General Circulation Model. The model
allows for arbitrary specification of obliquity, eccentricity, and
argument of perihelion as well as the position and thickness of surface
ice. Exchange of CO2 between the surface and atmosphere is
modeled, generating seasonal cycles of surface ice and surface pressure.
Water is allowed to exchange between the surface and atmosphere, cloud
formation is treated, and both cloud and vapor are transported by
modeled winds and diffusion. Exchange of water and CO2 with
the subsurface is not allowed, and radiative effects of water vapor and
clouds are not treated. The seasonal cycle of CO2 is found to
become more extreme at high obliquity, as suggested by simple heat
balance models. Maximum pressures remain largely the same, but the
minima decrease substantially as more CO2 condenses in the
more extensive polar night. Vapor and cloud abundances increase
dramatically with obliquity. The stable location for surface ice moves
equatorward with increasing obliquity, such that by 45° obliquity,
water ice is stable in the tropics only. Ice is not spatially uniform,
but rather found preferentially in regions of high thermal inertia or
high topography. Eccentricity and argument of perihelion can provide a
second-order modification to the distribution of surface ice by altering
the temporal distribution of insolation at the poles. Further model
simulations reveal the robustness of these distributions for a variety
of initial conditions. Our findings shed light on the nature of
near-surface, ice-rich deposits at midlatitudes and low-latitudes on
Mars.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Large eddy simulations of vertical convective vortices and dust devils
in the Martian convective boundary layer are presented, employing a
version of the Mars MM5 mesoscale model, adapted to use periodic
boundary conditions and run at resolutions of 10 to 100 m. The effects
of background horizontal wind speed and shear on dust devil development
are studied in four simulations, each extending over the daytime portion
of one Martian day. The general vorticity development in all cases is
similar, with roughly equal positive and negative vorticity extrema. Two
dust devils were found to develop in the highest wind speed case and in
a case run without background wind. The dust devil structures were found
to agree well qualitatively with terrestrial dust devil observations,
including the prediction of greatly diminished vertical velocities in
the vortex core. Thermodynamic scaling theory of dust devils was found
to provide good prediction of the relationship between central pressure
and temperature in the modeled vortices. Examination of the turbulent
kinetic energy budgets suggests balance between buoyancy generation and
loss through dissipation and transport. The vorticity for the dust
devils is provided by twisting of horizontal vorticity into the
vertical. The horizontal vorticity originates from horizontal variations
in temperature at the lower boundary (thermal buoyancy). While the
horizontal winds generated by the modeled dust devils were likely
insufficient to lift dust, this study provides a solid starting point
for dynamic modeling of what may be an important component of the
Martian dust cycle.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We investigate the triggering mechanism of a cross-equatorial dust storm
observed by Mars Global Surveyor in 1999. This storm, which had a
significant impact on global mean temperatures, was seen in visible and
infrared data to commence with the transport of linear dust fronts from
the northern high latitudes into the southern tropics. However, other
similar transport events observed in northern fall and winter did not
lead to large dust storms. Based on off-line Lagrangian particle
transport analysis using a high resolution Mars general circulation
model, we propose a simple explanation for the diurnal, seasonal and
interannual variability of this type of frontal activity, and of the
resulting dust storms, that highlights the cooperative interaction
between northern hemisphere fronts associated with low pressure cyclones
and tidally-modified return branch of the Hadley circulation.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A new technique has been developed for the treatment of hydrodynamic
loss processes from planetary atmospheres utilising the Godunov method.
A detailed description of a first order Godunov scheme is given by
Godunov (1959), Gombosi (1984), and Leveque (2002). Solving the
one-dimensional, steady state approximation becomes problematic at the
distance where the outflow becomes supersonic. This method overcomes the
instabilities inherent in modeling transonic conditions by solving the
coupled, time dependent mass, momentum, and energy equations, instead of
integrating time independent equations. We validate a preliminary model
of hydrodynamic escape against simple, idealised cases (viz., steady
state and isothermal conditions) showing that a robust solution obtains
and then compare to existing cases in the literature (Watson et al.,
1981; Kasting and Pollack, 1983; Chassefiere, 1996). A focus of this
work is on observable aspects of atmospheres that may be useful for
comparison between models and observations. "Close-in" hot Jupiter's
provide an ideal test case because of recent observations of HD 209458b.
The general tools developed here will be applied to various problems
such as the early Earth and Venus, and close-in extrasolar gas giant
planets and are directly applicable to modifications required for the
VPL terrestrial planet models.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In order to recognize signatures of life on extrasolar planets, a suite
of computer models called the VPL is being developed that will allow the
simulation of a broad range of planetary environments both with and
without life, and determination of the spectral signature of these
environments.  These tools represent a significant innovation for the
understanding of extrasolar planetary atmospheres and astronomical
biosignatures.  We present the overall VPL architecture and a validation
of the chemistry/climate/radiative transfer part of the model.  To
validate the model, we use simulations using a present day Martian model
atmosphere in conjunction with a Mie scattering dust column over surface
H2O ice.  In this way, we attempt to understand the degree to
which greenhouse effects produced by the dust particles in the Martian
atmosphere can allow for temperatures warm enough to permit the
formation of liquid surface water, which is required for the presence of
life.  Perturbing the parameters of the model will show if there is an
optimal amount of dust that can produce a greenhouse effect for periods
long enough to facilitate the presence of life on Mars.
