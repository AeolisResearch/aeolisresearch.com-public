<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We investigate the triggering, growth, decay and the inter-annual
variability of global dust storms (GDS) on Mars. To date, testing of
various theories of GDS initiation and variability has been limited by
inability to numerically simulate spontaneous, variable storm
development from realistic pre-storm model states. Here we describe
General Circulation Model simulations that generate spontaneous and
variable GDSs from realistic background conditions. Modelled GDSs
produce dramatic increases in atmospheric dustiness, global-mean air
temperatures, and atmospheric circulation, in accord with observations.
The simulations generate global storms in southern spring and summer
with significant inter-annual variability in size and timing of
occurrence, including years with no storms. We propose a simple
explanation for the observed dust cycle on Mars from our simulations.
Stresses associated with large-scale (&gt;300 km) wind systems initiate
the large storms. Explosive growth results from the intensification of
the Hadley circulation and the activation of secondary dust lifting
centers. Away from great storms, the annually repeatable cycle of
atmospheric temperatures and dust opacities observed in northern spring
and summer is a result of convective (dust devil) lifting.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The work of the wind is the one sedimentary process that both acts on
the surface and interacts with the lower atmosphere of Mars.
Wind-sculpted landforms such as sand dunes are among the few features
visible in spacecraft images that provide information on the aeolian
sedimentary environment and surface wind circulation patterns of Mars.
The study of the placement and orientations of sand dunes leads to the
depositional, erosional, and transport history of sand across a region.
When correlated with wind predictions from an atmospheric model, dune
orientations provide not only model verification but also an
understanding of the seasonal weather patterns that influence dune
morphology. We have applied a mesoscale model to Noachis Terra, an 1800
km x 3500 km area of Mars containing several dune fields. The Mars
Mesoscale Model 5 (Mars MM5), developed from the PSU/NCAR MM5, was run
in periods spanning the Martian year, predicting seasonal wind patterns
for each of nine dune fields in Noachis Terra. Dune slipface
orientations were measured for all dune fields imaged by the Mars
Orbiter Camera (MOC) on the Mars Global Surveyor. Preliminary results
indicate a high correspondence of dune morphology with present-day
seasonally-dependent wind patterns predicted by the Mars MM5.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The placement of water within the martian regolith may occur through any
of several means, the most important of which appear to be vapor
diffusion, surface adsorption and subaerial deposition.  In order to
understand the relative importance of  each of these modes during past
periods of higher obliquity, we have linked a vapor and thermal
diffusion model to the GFDL Mars GCM, and permitted water (as ice, vapor
or adsorbate) to interact freely between the atmosphere and regolith.
Our results strive to explain both the unique latitude-dependent terrain
found in the mid-latitudes of Mars and existence of the expansive
subsurface ice reservoirs discovered by Odyssey GRS data.  Results from
the Odyssey GRS instrument indicate ice abundances poleward of
60o (up to 90% by volume) vastly greater than one would
expect based upon simple diffusion and the assumed porosity (40%) of the
regolith.  This disparity led to our initial investigation into
subaerial deposition and subsequent sublimation as a means of inserting
ice within the regolith.  Our most recent work continues this
investigation, and permits us to explore the importance of surface
adsorption and diffusion of atmospheric vapor as well.  Earlier results
from the GFDL MGCM have suggested that at high obliquity, ice is not
homogeneously distributed across the surface within the latitude band
having the coldest annual mean temperatures.  Rather, water is
preferentially deposited as localized ice ``sheets'' in regions of high
thermal inertia and/or high topography.  Such findings neglected the
thermal inertia feedback of surface ice, which will permit ice to be
retained more uniformly within this latitude band.  This ice/thermal
inertia feedback has been included in our present work.  Lastly, we have
performed both 1-D and 3-D simulations of the regolith-atmosphere
interaction to determine the efficacy of the deposition-sublimation,
obliquity-dependent layering mechanism for a full obliquity cycle (
˜100,000 years).

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The unprecedented spatial resolution of the Mars Odyssey Thermal
Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) is used to infer and compare the
optical and thermal infrared properties of martian high-latitude and
polar surfaces. Materials of interest include the north polar layered
deposits (NPLD), the dark, dune-forming material associated with the
north polar cap complex,  and the ground ice-rich, latitude-dependent
layer (the landing site of the Phoenix Scout mission). To address these
goals, we have targeted and acquired THEMIS data as part of the Mars
Odyssey Participating Scientist program. We use these THEMIS data in
order to understand the morphology and color/thermal properties of the
NPLD over relevant (i.e., m to km) spatial scales. We have assembled
color mosaics of the data in order to map the distribution of ices, the
different layered units, dark material, and underlying basement. The
color information from THEMIS is crucial for distiguis-ing these
different units, which are less distinct on Mars Orbiter Camera images.
In the NPLD, we wish to understand the nature of the marginal scarps and
their relationship to the dark material. Co-registered Mars Orbiter
Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data provide a measure of scarp morphologies and
may help identify the process(es) eroding the NPLD (e.g., mass wast-ing,
wind, sublimation). The dark material (or perhaps a darker layered unit
in  planar configuration) is present at the feet of many scarps, but
expresses dune bedforms only tens of kilometers away from the scarps.
MOLA will help identify the relationship between the spatial
distribution of dark material, the presence of bedforms, and the
influence of topography. We have derived the thermophysical properties
of the different materials using THEMIS and Mars Global Surveyor Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (TES) data, also resulting in a new map of the
thermal inertia of Mars' northern hemisphere. Such analyses are
complicated by the need for atmospheric correction (of both radiatively
active CO2 and dust) and accurate surface temperatures. In order to
derive thermal inertias and thermally derived albedos, we employ a 1-D,
radiative-convective thermal model of Mars surface, subsurface and
atmosphere. The model uses simultaneous (or seasonally relevant) TES
atmospheric dust opacities. We also are studying the effects of surface
slopes on insolation using MOLA topographic data.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>THEMIS offers a unique opportunity to examine mesoscale atmospheric
features on Mars in the visible and infrared. The high spatial
resolution (˜100 meter per pixel) of the system comes at the cost
of imaging spatial coverage, requiring atmospheric features to be
targeted. Over the course of the past year, we have been targeting areas
and features identified in MOC WA imaging as part of a THEMIS
``atmospheric campaign."  These features include topographic cloud
systems, polar hood clouds, convective clouds, local dust storms in
Hellas and along the retreating edge of the southern seasonal ice cap,
and dust fronts in the northern high latitudes.  Typically 2-3 band
color images and 3-10 band infrared images have been acquired, both with
roughly 100 meters per pixel.  We will describe the targeting and its
rationale, show initial results from the campaign, and provide some
interpretation of observed features.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The discovery by Mars Odyssey of large deposits of subsurface ice in
regions where surface ice is no longer stable has raised questions about
putative past climatic conditions under different orbital states.  We
have used the GFDL Mars General Circulation Model (MGCM) as a tool for
examining these questions, and suggest that these deposits may be
quasi-stable permafrost remnants from an earlier period of high
obliquity, covered by a sublimation lag deposit formed when the mean
annual temperature exceeded the local frost point temperature.  We have
incorporated a thermal and vapor diffusion code into our GCM to simulate
the behavior of water in the regolith and the processes that move water
from the atmosphere to the surface and back.  Water in the regolith may
exist as vapor, ice or adsorbate, in relative abundances dependent upon
the soil  temperature and ambient pressure.  The model results show the
effectiveness of ice as a means to reduce the local thermal inertia,
thereby reducing annual maximum temperatures and increasing the
probability that surface ice deposits of a given thickness will survive
throughout the warmer summer, and hence build, essentially, a permafrost
layer over obliquity timescales.  The development of an ice sheet
beneath a sublimation lag appears similar to glacial remnants found in
the Antarctic Dry Valleys beneath tens of centimeters of sublimation
till.  On Earth, these deposits have existed, largely unchanged, for
millions of years.  On Mars, we suggest that these mid-latitude deposits
are several hundred thousand years old, at most-the remnant deposits of
the past few martian obliquity cycles.  The development of a sublimation
lag of a few tens of centimeters  seems to be enough to retain ice in
these regions until the next high obliquity period.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A new technique has been developed for the treatment of hydrodynamic
loss processes from planetary atmospheres utilising the Godunov method.
A detailed description of a first order Godunov scheme is given by
Godunov (1959), Gombosi (1984), and Leveque (2002). Solving the
one-dimensional, steady state approximation becomes problematic at the
distance where the outflow becomes supersonic. This method overcomes the
instabilities inherent in modeling transonic conditions by solving the
coupled, time dependent mass, momentum, and energy equations, instead of
integrating time independent equations. We validate a preliminary model
of hydrodynamic escape against simple, idealised cases (viz., steady
state and isothermal conditions) showing that a robust solution obtains
and then compare to existing cases in the literature (Watson et al.,
1981; Kasting and Pollack, 1983; Chassefiere, 1996). A focus of this
work is on observable aspects of atmospheres that may be useful for
comparison between models and observations. "Close-in" hot Jupiter's
provide an ideal test case because of recent observations of HD 209458b.
The general tools developed here will be applied to various problems
such as the early Earth and Venus, and close-in extrasolar gas giant
planets and are directly applicable to modifications required for the
VPL terrestrial planet models.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In order to recognize signatures of life on extrasolar planets, a suite
of computer models called the VPL is being developed that will allow the
simulation of a broad range of planetary environments both with and
without life, and determination of the spectral signature of these
environments.  These tools represent a significant innovation for the
understanding of extrasolar planetary atmospheres and astronomical
biosignatures.  We present the overall VPL architecture and a validation
of the chemistry/climate/radiative transfer part of the model.  To
validate the model, we use simulations using a present day Martian model
atmosphere in conjunction with a Mie scattering dust column over surface
H2O ice.  In this way, we attempt to understand the degree to
which greenhouse effects produced by the dust particles in the Martian
atmosphere can allow for temperatures warm enough to permit the
formation of liquid surface water, which is required for the presence of
life.  Perturbing the parameters of the model will show if there is an
optimal amount of dust that can produce a greenhouse effect for periods
long enough to facilitate the presence of life on Mars.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Seasonally-active water can be defined to include any water reservoir
that communicates with other reservoirs on time scales of a year or
shorter.  It is the interaction of these water reservoirs, under the
influence of varying solar radiation and in conjunction with surface and
atmospheric temperatures, that determines the phase-stability field for
water at the surface, and the distribution of water in various forms
below, on, and above the surface.  The atmosphere is the critical,
dynamical link in this cycling system, and also (fortunately) one of the
easiest to observe. Viking and Mars Global Surveyor observations paint a
strongly asymmetric picture of the global seasonal water cycle, tied
proximately to planetary eccentricity, and the existence of residual ice
caps of different composition at the two poles.  The northern summer
experiences the largest water vapour columns, and is associated with
sublimation from the northern residual water ice cap.  The southern
summer residual carbon dioxide ice cap is cold trap for water. 
Asymmetry in the water cycle is an unsolved problem.  Possible solutions
may involve the current timing of perihelion (the water cap resides at
the pole experiencing the longer but cooler summer), the trapping of
water ice in the northern hemisphere by tropical water ice clouds, and
the bias in the annual-average, zonal-mean atmospheric circulation
resulting from the zonal-mean difference in the elevation of the
northern and southern hemispheres. Adsorbed and frozen water have proven
harder to constrain.  Recent Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer results
suggest substantial ground ice in the mid- and high-latitudes, but this
water is likely below the seasonal skin depth for two reasons: the GRS
results are best fit with such a model, and GCM models of the water
cycle produce dramatically unrealistic atmospheric vapour distributions
when such a very near surface, GRS-like distribution is initialized -
ultimately removing the water to the northern and southern caps. Similar
climate-models of the water cycle also do not need much exchangeable
adsorbed water in order to explain the observed vapour distributions.
The possibility of liquid water is tantalizing, but difficult to
definitively judge.  On scales greater than a meter or so, Mars is most
definitely well away from the water triple point--although the surface
pressure can exceed 6.1 mbars, the partial pressure of water vapor (to
which the triple point refers) is at best orders of magnitude lower.
Several careful studies have shown, however, that locally transient
(meta-stable) liquid is possible, if the net heating of ice deposits is
high enough.  This process is aided if the total surface pressure
exceeds 6.1mbar (this prevents boiling, or the explosive loss of vapour
into the atmosphere) or if the liquid is covered by a thin ice shell,
and is only possible if surface temperatures exceed 273K (for pure
water, or the appropriate eutectic for brines) and if ice is present. 
The former challenge is much easier to meet than the latter. The melt
scenario requires that ice deposited in winter must be protected from
sublimation as surface temperatures increase in spring, but then exposed
to the peak of solar heating in summer. Available spacecraft
observations of seasonal water will be discussed with the aid of GCM
model simulations, and examined in the context of water distributions
and phases.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Mars' orbital parameters (obliquity, eccentricity and argument of
perihelion) are thought to have varied substantially on time scales
&gt;105 years.  Such variations, especially in obliquity, may
drastically affect the circulation of the atmosphere and volatile
cycling.  In this study, we focus on the response of the water and
carbon dioxide cycles to changes in these orbital parameters, chiefly
obliquity.  The study employs the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
Mars General Circulation Model, conducting simulations over a range of
orbital states to examine changes in the cycling and deposition of these
volatiles.  This model contains full 3D accounting of atmospheric water
and carbon dioxide as well as a basic dust cycle. The present martian
obliquity is 25°, though it is believed to have recently varied
between 15 and 45 degrees.  Our simulations look at present martian
conditions, only with obliquity varying between 5 and 60 degrees.
Simulations are run out until water and carbon dioxide budgets have
reached equilibrium--typically 30-40 years. As expected, volatile
cycling on Mars increases with obliquity, as the polar caps are exposed
to increased insolation, leading to greater seasonal ice caps and
ultimately development of surface water ice in the now thermally
favorible low latitudes.  By 45°, water ice is stable in a broad
band just north of the equator.  Such an ice distribution has potential
implications for the surface wind pattern through the ice-albedo effect
on surface heating.  Permanent polar CO2 caps are not stable
under present conditions, but we find CO2 cap growth and
corresponding atmospheric deflation to be evident at very low
obliquities.  We find that for most choices of orbital conditions, the
northern hemisphere remains the stable pole for water ice, a result of
the martian topographic dichotomy. We have begun to look at the impact
of desorbed CO2 and H2O ice from the regolith on
climatic conditions.  Present estimates of the volatile abundance in the
regolith vary greatly, but recent Mars Odyssey results hint at large
abundances of water ice in the martian high-latitude regolith. The
results of this study should better define models of polar volatile
evolution, specifically those of layered terrain formation. The
radiative feedback effects of increased atmospheric CO2 and
H2O from the polar caps and regoliths has yet to be examined.
Future plans include more accurate representations of dust injection and
radiative transfer to tackle this problem.

<td>The circulation of the Martian atmosphere may be substantially affected
by changes in orbital parameters. Such changes will undoubtedly alter
the seasonal distribution of incident solar radiation on time scales
greater than 105 years, and hence the forcing of the
atmospheric circulation.  For this investigation, we focus on the
response of the general circulation to changes in obliquity,
eccentricity, and argument of perihelion.  We use the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Mars General Circulation Model (GCM) to
examine changes in the nature of the Hadley circulation, polar jets, and
eddies as orbital elements are varied. A number of basic findings emerge
from the simulations. For example, the Hadley cell exhibits strongly
non-continuous variation with obliquity.  As obliquity is increased from
0o, the northern summer circulation retains an
equinoctial-like dual cell pattern until obliquity exceeds
10o.  Only after that does the dominant cross-equatorial cell
pattern emerge.  Conversely, the southern hemisphere summer cell
develops a strong cross-equatorial pattern at obliquities below
5o.  This starkly asymmetric Hadley cell behaviour results
from the global mean topographic slope.  The simulations also highlight
other ways in which topography places a control on the extent and
strength of the Martian Hadley circulations.  The polar jet is also
affected by changes in obliquity.  For obliquities above 45o,
we find that the expanded and strengthened descending branch of the
Hadley cell adiabatically warms the polar regions, reducing the
latitudinal temperature gradient and decreasing the strength of the
corresponding polar jet.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The observed year-to-year repeatability of Martian atmospheric
temperatures and dust opacities in northern spring and summer suggests
that the seasonal cycle of Martian atmospheric dustiness cannot be
explained uniquely in terms of large (regional and global scale) dust
storms.  Instead, a steady source of atmospheric dust is needed that
generates a seasonal supply pattern that is essentially repeatable. 
Dust devils have been widely suggested to operate in this role. 
Theoretical studies  to date have mainly focused on analytical models of
dust devils as thermodynamic and dynamic systems.  In this presentation,
we discuss three-dimensional, numerical simulations of the Martian
convective boundary layer, and specifically convective vortex/dust devil
development.  The simulations are undertaken with the Mars MM5 mesoscale
atmospheric model developed at Caltech and Cornell University.  The
model is nonhydrostatic, and employs parameterizations for heat
diffusion in the Martian  subsurface, radiative heating due to dust and
carbon dioxide gas in the visible and thermal infrared, radiatively and
dynamically interactive dust, and (where applicable) the cycling of
carbon dioxide and water between the surface and atmosphere.  In these
simulations of the Martian boundary layer, the model is used with a
horizontal grid spacing of 20 to 100 m, and with a minimum of 100 points
in each direction, and over 50 levels in the vertical direction.  We
initially simulate a region near the equator, with surface properties
characteristic of the Sinus Meridiani ("Hematite") region and for  mid
southern summer.  We also show simulations for a location in the
northern tropics and with surface properties consistent  with the
Amazonis Planitia region.  These simulations are conducted near southern
spring equinox, a time when Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images suggest
development of copious, massive dust devil structures.  In all cases, we
find evidence for the development of convective, vertically aligned
vortices.  We will discuss the nature and behavior of the various
vortices developed in the simulations.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present results from an orbital survey of Martian dust devils using
the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) wide- and
narrow-angle (WA and NA) images.  The survey includes all available
imaging data (mapping and pre-mapping orbit), through to mission phase
E06.  Due to the large volume of data, we have concentrated on surveying
limited regions, selected variously on the basis of where dust devils or
other dust storm activity has previously been reported, on the basis of
where lander observations have been or will be obtained, and on the
basis of predictions from numerical atmospheric models. Our study
regions to date include: Amazonis Planitia (25-45N, 145-165W), Sinus
Meridiani (10S-10N, 10E-10W), Chryse Planitia (10-30N, 30-60W), Solis
Planum (15-45S, 75-105W), Hellas Planitia (15-60S, 265-315W), Casius
(45-65N, 255-285W), Utopia Planitia (25-45N, 225-255W), Sinai Planum
(10-20S, 60-100W), Mare Cimmerium (10-45S, 180-220W).  We have compiled
statistics on dust devil activity in three categories: dust devils
observed in NA images, dust devils observed in WA images, and dust devil
tracks observed in NA images. For each region and each category, we have
compiled statistics for four seasonal date bins, centered on the
equinoxes and solstices: Ls=45-135 (northern summer solstice),
Ls=135-225 (northern autumn equinox), Ls=225-315 (northern winter
solstice), and Ls=315-45 (northern spring equinox). Our survey has
highlighted great spatial variability in dust devil activity, with the
Amazonis Planitia region being by far the dominant location for
activity.  This region is additionally characterized by a large size
range of dust devils, including individual devils up to several km in
height.  Other regions in which dust devils have been frequently imaged
include Utopia, Solis, and Sinai.  Numerous dust devil tracks were
observed in Casius and Cimmerium, but with very few accompanying dust
devils.  This suggests dust devils occurring in local times other than
that of the MGS orbit (~2pm). Our seasonal statistics suggest a very
strong preference for Amazonis and Solis dust devil activity to occur in
the northern autumn season.  Conversely, Utopia shows dust devil
activity which is relatively constant, except in the northern spring
period. The observations will be presented, and compared with numerical
model predictions.  Initial results from this survey have already been
used to define target regions for very high resolution simulations of
dust devil development using the Caltech/Cornell Mars MM5 model.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Simplified models of planetary climate require a parameterization for
the equator-to-pole transport of heat and its dependence on factors,
including the planetary rotation rate.  Various such parameterizations
exist, including ones based on the theory of baroclinic eddy mixing, and
on principles of global entropy generation.  However, such
parameterizations are difficult to test given the limited available
observational opportunities.  In this study, we use a numerical model to
examine heat flux dependencies, as part of a wider study of circulation
regime sensitivity to rotation rates and other parameters. This study
makes use of a simplified version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory (GFDL) "Skyhi" General Circulation Model (GCM).  All
terrestrial hydrological processes have been stripped from the model,
which in the form used here, is adapted from the Martian version of
Skyhi.  The atmosphere has the gas properties of CO2, except
that it has been made uncondensible.  No aerosols or surface ices are
allowed.  The model surface is flat, and of uniform albedo and thermal
inertia.  For the simulations presented in this study, the diurnal,
seasonal, and eccentricity cycles have been disabled ({ i.e.} the
surface and atmosphere receives constant, daily- and seasonally-averaged
incident solar radiation). Radiative heating is treated with a band
model for CO2 gas in the thermal and near-infrared bands. The
use of a complex model to examine simplified theory of heat transport
requires some justification since it is not necessarily clear that these
models (GCM's) provide an accurate emulation of the real atmosphere (of
any given planet).  In this study, we have intentionally removed those
aspects of GCM's that are of greatest concern.  Especially for
terrestrial GCM's, the hydrologic cycle is a major source of uncertainty
due to radiative feedbacks, and cloud coupling to small-scale,
convective mixing.  For other planets, aerosols are important as
radiatively and dynamical active species.  Yet an additional cause of
error, especially when testing global entropy principles, is the
condensation of the atmosphere (as in  the case of Mars).  We have
eliminated all of these concerns in the pure, non-condensible gas
atmosphere of our simplified model.  Our results will be compared with 
those of simplified theoretical predictions, and differences discussed.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The meteorology of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) candidate landing
sites is of importance because of the constraint it provides on the
likely ability of the rovers to successfully land and operate.  The
meteorology may also be of interest insofar as the landscapes to be
traversed and studied by the rovers may be influenced to a greater or
lesser degree by aeolian activity.  In support of the MER Program, we
have conducted studies of several of the candidate landing sites using
the Mars Mesoscale Model developed at Caltech and Cornell University as
an adaptation of the terrestrial PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5).  The
sites studied include Meridiani (``Hematite"), Gusev, and Mellas.  The
model results suggest that winds associated with convection and/or
topography may be of concern at each of the landing sites.  The
relatively flat Hematite site is simulated to develop strong, deep
convection.  At highest resolution (few hundred meters), the convection
is predicted to be cellular with significant up- and down-drafts. The
local time of landing for both MER rovers is during the period of most
active convection at all sites.  Gusev and Mellas show varying degrees
of topographic influence on winds.  At Gusev, the crater walls provide
strong foci for upslope-downslope circulations, while the walls and
other nearby topography provide ``anchor" points for the initiation
(initial upwelling) of convection during the day.  Mellas provides a
case example  of strongly channelized flow.  Convection is less of a
concern at Mellas, but is replaced by diurnally reversing up-canyon and
down-canyon flow.  The flow patterns are also strongly influenced by the
effects of canyon wall heating by solar radiation. In summary, the thin
Martian atmosphere responds strongly to slope heating by developing
slope winds which provide  a challenge to missions seeking to closely
approach ``interesting" terrain.  Equally a problem for the MER mission,
for flat  landing sites, is the use of an early afternoon local time of
landing, coinciding with the peak of boundary layer convection.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) is continuing the infrared
global monitoring of Martian dust and water ice aerosols as well as
atmospheric temperatures started by the Mariner 9 Infrared
Interferometric Spectrometer (IRIS), Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper
(IRTM), and the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Thermal Emission Spectrometer
(TES) instruments.  Aerosol optical depth is retrieved in a manner
similar to retrieval algorithms used with TES data.  THEMIS 9 point
spectra are converted to the equivalent column integrated optical depth.
The relative contributions of dust and water ice to the observed
optical depth are then determined using a least squares fit of
predetermined water ice and dust opacity spectral shapes to the measured
THEMIS optical depth.  Several refinements have been made to the aerosol
opacity retrieval algorithms for increased accuracy of both aerosol
abundances as well as surface temperatures.  The opacity retrieval
algorithm iteratively solves for a self-consistent solution for surface
temperature as well as aerosol abundance.  As a result, no atmospheric
transparency wavelength needs to be assumed.  Surface emissivity maps
are also now incorporated into the retrieval algorithm.  Results to date
are consistent with concurrent TES observations, displaying low dust
opacities and the onset of the perihelion water ice cloud belt as Mars
progresses towards northern summer.  The Mars Odyssey mission plan
includes observations that drift from local times of approximately 3-6
PM.  These local times combined with concurrent TES observations of a
local time of 2 PM will allow for some resolution of diurnal atmospheric
variations, such as water ice cloud abundances.  The THEMIS
investigation will extend the continuous infrared monitoring of the
Martian atmosphere, bridging the MGS TES and the 2005 Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) investigations. 
This continuous long-term monitoring is essential for the understanding
of the atmospheric processes and cycles present in the Martian
atmosphere.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Martian dust storm provides one of the most spectacular examples of
transient meteorological phenomena in the solar system. While most
Martian dust lifting events are local in scale, tens to hundreds of
kilometers, some are regional storms thousands of kilometers in size,
and a few have been observed to initiate global dust storms that shroud
the entire planet. Large dust storms represent the most dramatic
component of the Martian dust cycle - one of the three main cycles
determining the climate on Mars. They can generate significant
perturbations of the global climate, increasing mid-level air
temperatures by tens of degrees Kelvin. These storms can be categorized
as major storms. Observations before Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) indicate
that classical major dust storms originate in the southern hemisphere
during the "dust storm season" of southern spring and summer
(Ls=180-360). It was suspected that the dynamics of major dust storms
involve feedback between the atmospheric circulation and radiative
heating of lofted dust. However, there has been little success in
providing mechanisms to explain the origin and/or transience of major
storms. Recently, a new category of major dust storm has been
identified, with dust lifting initially associated with
northern-hemisphere fronts, and involving flushing of dust from the
northern to southern hemisphere. Such "flushing" dust storms are mainly
observed in mid northern fall and mid northern winter. We present a
mechanism for the development of these storms, including natural
explanations for diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variability of the
storms. Dust flushing from the northern hemisphere requires coherence
and cooperation between three major dynamical systems: baroclinic
storms, thermal tides, and the Hadley circulation. Once dust is flushed
into the southern hemisphere, accumulation of dust in the Hadley
convergence zone will greatly increase the strength of the circulation,
leading to major dust storm. These results provide not only a coherent
picture of major storm development and transience, but also an example
of cooperative interaction of Mars' major dynamical systems over
planetary length-scales.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Comprehensive inter-comparison of thermal infrared data collected by
Mariner 9, Viking, and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) is presented, with a
specific focus on air temperatures, dust opacities, and water ice
opacities. Emphasis is placed upon creating a uniform data set so as to
most effectively reduce inter-instrument biases and offsets. We show
that the globally-averaged martian atmosphere executes an exceedingly
repeatable annual cycle of air temperature, closing in northern spring
and summer to within a Kelvin. The annual cycle shows a strong asymmetry
about the equinoxes, with northern summer showing relatively low
temperatures and essentially no short-term (tens of days) variability.
Viking and MGS air temperatures are essentially indistinguishable,
suggesting that the Viking and MGS eras are characterized by exactly the
same climatic state. Southern summer is characterized by strong dust
storm activity, and we note that the period around Ls=225 is
characterized by very high dust opacities associated with dust storm
development or decay in every year thus far observed by spacecraft. Dust
opacity shows a highly repeatable annual cycle, closing to essentially
the same values each year in northern spring and summer, with Viking and
MGS opacities being very similar. We show that both Viking and MGS data
sets show significant (and similar) polar cap edge dust storm activity.
The origins of the various major dust storms can be identified in the
thermal infrared data from Viking and MGS, including the "flushing" of
dust from the northern autumn baroclinic zone into the southern
hemisphere tropics, which has also been identified in visible imaging.
Water ice opacities have been retrieved from Viking infrared data for
the first time. We show that the cloud belt structure and evolution is
essentially the same in each of the multiple years observed by Viking
and MGS. Relatively subtle spatial features recur in the cloud belt from
year-to-year, suggesting the influence of surface topography and
thermophysical properties, and consistent supply of water vapor. The
seasonal evolution of the tropical cloud belt through northern spring
and summer is shown, with the only significant deviations between years
occurring from Ls=140-160, where opacities fall in the second MGS year
associated with a small dust storm. Polar hood clouds are observed in
the Viking and MGS observations with similar timing and extent. It would
seem that the martian atmosphere executes a very repeatable annual cycle
of atmospheric phenomena, with the only significant exception being the
occurrence of major dust events. After such dust events, the atmosphere
rapidly relaxes to its stable, repeatable state.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>With the successful entry of the Mars Odyssey spacecraft into mapping
orbit in early 2002 (Ls=330), the Thermal Emission Imaging System
(THEMIS) joins Mars Global Surveyor TES in monitoring Martian
atmospheric temperatures and aerosol opacity using thermal infrared
remote sensing from Mars orbit. The THEMIS 15-micron channel (Band 10)
can be used in the same way as the Viking IRTM 15-micron channel to give
temperatures integrated over a broad portion of the atmosphere centered
at about 0.6 mbar. The characteristic signatures of dust and water ice
aerosols that are clearly evident in the other THEMIS channels can be
used to estimate atmospheric opacity. Here, we give an overview of the
latest atmospheric results from both THEMIS and TES during the northern
winter and spring seasons (Ls=270-90). Included during this period were
the decay of the 2001a planet-encircling dust storm, the growth and
establishment of the low-latitude aphelion water-ice cloud belt, and the
annual globally-averaged minima of water vapor, dust, and atmospheric
temperature.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The planet Venus is our most Earth-like neighbor in size, mass, and
distance from the sun. In spite of these similarities, and the intense
scrutiny that it received early in the space age, the Venus surface and
atmosphere are characterized by some of the most enigmatic features seen
anywhere in the solar system. A reinvigorated Venus exploration program
is essential to the development of a comprehensive understanding of the
origin and evolution of Earth-like terrestrial planets. The present NASA
inner planets strategy, which focuses exclusively on Mars, will provide
an incomplete, and possibly misleading description of processes that
produce these objects. If Venus-like terrestrial planets are common,
this approach will also impede efforts to interpret observations of
extrasolar terrestrial planets, which are expected to become available
by the end of the decade. Here, we propose a Venus exploration program
that has been designed to explain the origin and divergent evolution of
the interiors, surfaces, and atmospheres of the terrestrial planets in
our solar system, and provide greater insight into the conditions that
may affect the habitability of terrestrial planets in other solar
systems.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The water cycle is one of the most important mechanisms shaping the
current climate of Mars. Recent progress in climate monitoring with the
Mars Global Surveyor's TES instrument has revealed new features of the
water cycle, including its strong coupling with the atmospheric
circulation. We have implemented comprehensive simulation of
hydrological processes in the GFDL Mars General Circulation Model,
including at- mospheric transport and microphysics of water ice clouds
and their coupling with dust and radiative balance. It is shown that the
seasonal migration of water between polar regions and tropics is
strongly influenced by the microphysical properties of clouds and the
Hadley cell circulation. The intensity and zonal structure of this
circulation is, in turn, sensitive to radiative forcing by aerosols. In
order to determine how various mechanisms influence the water cycle, we
present sensitivity studies against dust load- ing and microphysical
processes in clouds. Multiannual simulations with a reduced
self-consistent microphysical scheme have been carried out to address
the stability of the current surface water inventory and the origin of
its prominent interhemispherical asymmetry.
