<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>General circulation models (GCMs) of the Venus atmosphere are currently forced using only simplified parameterizations of the radiative forcing and boundary conditions, such as those discussed in Yamamoto and Takahashi (JAS, 2003) or Lee, Lewis and Read (JGR, 2007). Using these parameterizations, suitable dynamical cores produce a qualitatively realistic circulation with super-rotation and transient planetary waves. The quantitative accuracy of the GCMs varies with dynamical core and the particular numerical parameterizations employed. However, all current GCMs exhibit sensitivity to the numerical parameterizations used to describe the behavior of the boundary conditions and the sub grid-scale eddy activity. These parameterizations are often used to reduce the grid-scale noise and unwanted propagating waves caused by discretization in the models We discuss the response of the numerical cores used in a number of simplified Venus GCMs using their various boundary layer and sub grid-scale parameterizations, and forcing with the radiative parameterizations outlined in Lee, Lewis and Read (JGR, 2007). The numerical cores tested include the PlanetWRF model (Caltech/NCAR), FMS (GFDL/NOAA) and HadAM3 (Oxford/Hadley Centre). We also discuss a possible physical interpretation of the sensitivities we have investigated and suggest corrections to the parameterizations used in these simplified GCMs. These corrections should provide more physically reasonable parameterizations for the thick Venus atmosphere, and in turn reduce the sensitivity to the numerical parameterizations such as the horizontal hyper-diffusion used to damp grid-scale waves, or the Rayleigh friction used to damp vertically propagating waves. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Recent comparisons of global snap-shots of Mars' surface taken by the Viking and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) cameras have been used to suggest that Mars has darkened, and hence has warmed, between the 1970's and 1990's. While this conclusion is not supported by more quantitative analysis of albedo data, the idea of Martian darkening and warming has found its way into the terrestrial climate change debate. Through blogs and other opinion pieces it has been used, both amusingly and disturbingly, to argue that Mars' apparent natural warming should alleviate our concerns about anthropomorphic climate change on Earth. Relating planetary research results to terrestrial analogs is instructive and promotes public understanding, but this example provides a cautionary tale of misinterpretation in this age of politicized science. The dust cycle is the dominant short-term component of the Martian climate. The atmosphere is strongly forced via dust's modification of atmospheric radiative heating rates, while dust loading displays dramatic interannual variability, from background opacity to aperiodic global dust storms. Until recently, the atmospheric component of the dust cycle was better documented than the surface component (which on Mars can be gauged via albedo). But now thanks to the combination of regional imaging, spot thermal infrared spectra, and spot short-wavelength photometry sampled at synoptic time and length scales by MGS, a rich new view of the relationship between specific meteorological phenomena and the patterns of surface dust is emerging. Seasonal cap winds, local, regional, and global dust storms, and monsoonal circulations all redistribute surface dust on large spatial scales, while dust devils are surprisingly shown to be insignificant. Rapid and widespread albedo modification is accomplished by storms that darken relatively bright regions through dust removal, and deposit dust upon largely dust free areas, brightening them. (It is not possible with existing data to infer dust deposition or erosion in perennially dusty areas.) However, most of the dust deposited on darker regions is removed within one Martian year. This rapid cleaning suggests that darker areas retain their dust-free albedo over decadal time scales because any dust deposited there can be eroded at commonly experienced wind speeds. Bright regions recover more slowly, sometimes requiring several martian years. The depletion of these dust sources in some years may play an important role in the interannual variability in dust storm occurrence and intensity by introducing a multiyear "memory" into the system. The observation of the 2001 global storm and its wake allows predictions to be made for the recovery following the 2007 global storm: the southern hemisphere should retain a transient brightening until after the seasonal cap has advanced and retreated. The MGS data show that albedo is a dynamic and evolving meteorologically and climatologically active variable, not a static boundary condition. Overall, the major story that albedo has to tell is one of major dust storms and recovery from them &amp;150; not of secular changes &amp;150; and that the changes are mostly cyclic such that surfaces tend to return to their pre-storm albedos. We speculate that this system of fine balances is dynamically controlled, such that interannual occurrence of dust storms and the partial dust coating of the surface should be robust against the expected large changes of orbital parameters throughout Martian geological history. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We model the variation of non-condensable trace gases that results from the seasonal cycle of CO2 on Mars. A simple condensation scheme has been incorporated into MarsWRF, a 3-dimensional numerical model for the atmospheres of Mars. Non-condensable trace gas (mostly N2 and Ar) mass mixing ratios are affected by the phase change of CO2 and by transport. The distribution of Ar abundance has been observed by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on the Mars 2001 Odyssey spacecraft. We are able to qualitatively reproduce the Ar observations, including the seasonal evolving latitudinal distribution. However, the modeled magnitudes of maximum enrichment are lower than observed. Smoothing Ar enrichment in the vertical reduces susceptibility to transport by near-surface, off-cap circulation, therefore gives further enhancement of non-condensable tracer in the winter pole. We suggest that a missing process in the model may account for the underestimation. An extra buoyancy term in the dynamics should result from the vertical gradient in mean molecular mass as Ar mass mixing ratio increases. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Quantitative study of Mars weather and climate will ultimately stem from analysis of its dynamic and thermodynamic fields. Of all the observations of Mars available to date, such fields are most easily derived from mapping data (radiances) of the martian atmosphere as measured by orbiting infrared spectrometers and radiometers (e.g., MGS / TES and MRO / MCS).  Such data-derived products are the solutions to inverse problems, and while individual profile retrievals have been the popular data-derived products in the planetary sciences, the terrestrial meteorological community has gained much ground over the last decade by employing techniques of data assimilation (DA) to analyze radiances. Ancillary information is required to close an inverse problem (i.e., to disambiguate the family of possibilities that are consistent with the observations), and DA practitioners inevitably rely on numerical models for this information (e.g., general circulation models (GCMs)). Data assimilation elicits maximal information content from available observations, and, by way of the physics encoded in the numerical model, spreads this information spatially, temporally, and across variables, thus allowing global extrapolation of limited and non-simultaneous observations.  If the model is skillful, then a given, specific model integration can be corrected by the information spreading abilities of DA, and the resulting time sequence of "analysis" states are brought into agreement with the observations.  These analysis states are complete, gridded estimates of all the fields one might wish to diagnose for scientific study of the martian atmosphere.  Though a numerical model has been used to obtain these estimates, their fidelity rests in their simultaneous consistency with both the observations (to within their stated uncertainties) and the physics contained in the model.  In this fashion, radiance observations can, say, be used to deduce the wind field. A new class of DA approaches based on Monte Carlo approximations, "ensemble-based methods," has matured  enough to be both appropriate for use in planetary problems and exploitably within the reach of planetary scientists.  Capitalizing on this new class of methods, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has  developed a framework for ensemble-based DA that is flexible and modular in its use of various forecast models  and data sets.  The framework is called DART, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed, and it is freely available on-line.  We have begun to take advantage of this rich software infrastructure, and are on our way toward performing state of the art DA in the martian atmosphere using Caltech's martian general circulation model, PlanetWRF. We have begun by testing and validating the model within DART under idealized scenarios, and we hope to address actual, available infrared remote sensing datasets from Mars orbiters in the coming year.  We shall present the details of this approach and our progress to date. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We will present results from multi-annual simulations of methane
condensation in the troposphere of Titan, using the global version of
the TitanWRF atmospheric model. TitanWRF is the Titan version of the
PlanetWRF model (Richardson et al., 2007, JGR, in press). PlanetWRF
differs from the model upon which it is based, NCAR's Weather Research
and Forecasting model (www.wrf-model.org), in that it (a) can be run in
global as well as limited area mode, and (b) is structured to be easily
adapted to planets other than the Earth.

The methane condensation scheme includes for example (i) a surface
source, depending on the sub-saturation of the lowest atmospheric layer
and the strength of near-surface winds, as in Tokano et al. (2001,
Icarus, 153, 130-147); (ii) determination of the type of condensate
produced (methane ice or a binary liquid including dissolved nitrogen)
depending on temperature; (iii) inclusion of a decrease in saturation
vapor pressure for the binary liquid; (iv) different assumptions about
the fate of any condensate produced.

Preliminary results show some interesting similarities to the observed
location and timing of Titan clouds, and suggest further investigations
which will also be discussed.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Since the work of Eden and Vonnegut (1973, Science, 180, 962-963), it has been hypothesized that the lower atmosphere of Mars
might be highly electrically active during dusty conditions. This electrical activity supposedly results from the charging
of dust and sand particles by collisions with other dust and sand particles of contrasting size and/or composition and the
discharge of these particles into an atmosphere with a low breakdown potential. Farrell et al. (1999, JGR, 104, 3795-3801)
and Renno et al. (2003, GRL, 30, 2140) have proposed that these electrical discharges might be a source of intense non-thermal
radiation and therefore detectable.

In this work, we synthesize the work of Farrell et al. (1999) and Renno et al. (2003) into a model of non-thermal radiation
(primarily UHF) produced by emission from arc discharges between sand and dust particles. Although this model is highly unconstrained,
it can provide insight into the source characteristics of such radiation. We use this model to analyze the observations of
Busch et al. (this meeting) and consider the implications of our analysis for surface spacecraft operations, enhancement of
dust lifting by strong electric fields (Kok and Renno, 2006, GRL, 33, L19S10), meteorological monitoring, and lower atmosphere
chemical synthesis on Mars (Atreya et al., 2006, Astrobiology, 6, 439).

<td>The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) is currently making detailed measurements

radiometer operating in eight spectral channels in the mid and far
infrared with a broadband 0.3 to 3 micron channel for measurements of
solar radiation reflected from the Martian surface. In this paper, we
describe the measurement approach and the weather and climate objectives
of MCS. The instrument observes the limb of the atmosphere from 0 to 80
km altitude with 5 km vertical resolution, and the surface at nadir and
off-nadir angles, including excellent coverage of the bi-directional
reflection functions of polar caps. Initial observations of the Martian

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Data assimilation is a suite of techniques that has proven useful to
studies in terrestrial atmospheric science. Data assimilation elicits
the information content in observations in order to improve one's
estimate of the atmospheric state, typically the state of a numerical
model.  The improved estimate is the ideal data product to be queried
and diagnosed for scientific study of dynamics, circulation, and
transport.  Martian atmospheric modeling efforts have been improving,
and several models can now reasonably reproduce the climate implied by
historical observations (e.g., MGS / TES).  The global planetary version
of WRF (NCAR's mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model) is one
such model that can reasonably simulate the martian atmosphere and its
variability.  Previous data assimilation efforts for the martian
atmosphere have used techniques that assume stationary error statistics.
Our intent is to combine the information content in observations from
the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) with the global planetary version of WRF
configured for Mars using a modern data assimilation technique, proven
in terrestrial applications, which approximates the evolution of
atmospheric error statistics. Terrestrial research experience has shown
that ensemble-based data assimilation approaches (e.g., the ensemble
Kalman filter) are effective when observations are relatively sparse
because their flow-dependent error estimates can maximally spread
observational information content.  Having a data stream from a single
orbiting atmospheric sounder should provide a good test bed for such
approaches in a martian context.  We present our initial tests and
thoughts for how ensemble-based data assimilation can provide improved
martian atmospheric state estimates using MCS data.  We also discuss
unique challenges for performing data assimilation in the martian
atmosphere.  We initially focus on assimilating retrieved profiles, but
we intend to address directly assimilating radiances.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>MarsWRF is a new general circulation model of the Martian atmosphere. A
modified, planetary version of the terrestrial, mesoscale Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, MarsWRF can operate as either a
limited area or global model, and can be run with higher resolution
regions embedded within the outer domain. We will present first results
from using the basic global version of MarsWRF to simulate the Martian
dust cycle, with two dust lifting processes (near-surface wind stress
and dust devils) and with dust as both a passive and an active tracer.
In the latter case, we will examine the feedbacks between injected dust
and the atmospheric state, and will discuss the realism of the
simulations and our future plans for improvement. We will also outline
future plans to run MarsWRF with embedded high resolution domains in key
lifting areas, and discuss how this will enable us to study multi-scale
feedbacks.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Martian clouds are often seen over volcanoes, Valles Marineris and
troughs in Polar Regions. A basic mechanism of cloud formation is that
an air parcel with water vapor is lifted in the vertical wind, becomes
saturated due to colder surrounding air, and the vapor transforms to
water ice. We will show simulation results of cloud formation with the
Planetary Weather Research and Forecasting (planetWRF) model. It has
been modified at Caltech from the terrestrial mesoscale WRF model
developed mainly by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
It can simulate, for example, the diurnal / seasonal change of wind
direction and temperature profile in a limited area with high spatial
resolution. Currently we have two microphysics schemes. The first
includes heterogeneous nucleation, growth and sublimation of water ice
particles, and sedimentation due to gravity. Particles are allowed to
precipitate to the surface and form frost. The second is a much faster,
simpler parameterization in which the parameter choices are based on the
results of the first method. Using the latter scheme decreases the
computational time greatly.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We present an update of THEMIS-VIS observations of clouds in the Martian
mesosphere.  These observations were previously discussed by McConnochie
et al. [2005, Eos Trans. AGU, 86(52), Fall Meet. Suppl., Abstract
P21E-03].  In addition to the ongoing THEMIS-VIS studies, recent
observations of mesospheric clouds by Mars Global Surveyor [Clancy et
al. 2004, Bull. Amer. Astron. Soc., 36 pg. 1128], and by SPICAM on Mars
Express [Montmessin et al., 2006, Icarus 183, 403-410], are contributing
to a rapid evolution in our understanding of these high-altitude
aerosols. THEMIS-VIS measures cloud altitude using the parallax drift of
high-altitude features, and the velocity by exploiting the time delay in
the THEMIS-VIS imaging sequence.  Additionally, the high resolution
nadir-pointed THEMIS-VIS observations show cloud morphologies at scales
on the order of 30 meters per pixel. The new results that we present
include the distribution of the mesospheric clouds in location, season,
altitude and velocity; comparison of the cloud velocities with GCM wind
estimates; morphological classification of the clouds; and inferences
about the mass, particle size, and composition of the aerosols derived
from radiative transfer modeling.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>It has been suggested that cirrus clouds formed of CO2 gas may have
significantly affected the early history of the climate of Mars.
Evidence of the existence of CO2 ice clouds in the current atmosphere of
Mars has also been reported. We implement a CO2 microphysics scheme to
the PlanetWRF Model and focus on its applications in the Martian
environment. This physical scheme includes heterogenous nucleation,
homogenous nucleation, ion nucleation and CO2 ice particle growth. CO2
ice physics is coupled with the dust cycle, CO2 cycle and possibly water
cycle. With followed radiative transfer study and comparison with
spacecraft data products, we hope to have better insight into the
history of the climate of Mars and its current circulating cycles.
Complete understanding of the role that CO2 ice clouds play in the
Martian climate system requires both modeling and laboratory work of CO2
ice formation processes, which have become two of the most urgent tasks
in the Mars science community.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Valles Marineris is the deepest canyon on Mars, and its topography
affects the climate both globally and locally. The equatorial cloud belt
appears from areocentric solar longitudes of 45 to 150 degrees, and the
clouds associated with the valley are a part of it. Before the main belt
developed in 2004, the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the
spectrometer OMEGA on board Mars Express observed a dusty haze floating
inside the valley. It became thinner after three days, and disappeared
within ten days.

The Planetary Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been
modified at Caltech from the terrestrial mesoscale WRF model developed
mainly by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It can
simulate the diurnal / seasonal change of wind direction and temperature
profile in a limited area with high spatial resolution. Formations of
clouds and dust hazes strongly depend on these phenomena. We will
present the results of mesoscale simulations of Valles Marineris in
Northern spring to summer.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>PlanetWRF is a global, planetary version of the mesoscale, Earth-based
WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model (www.wrf-model.org). With
minimal changes, and using the same basic dynamical core and
parameterizations of physical processes, it may be run as a global,
mesoscale, LES (large eddy simulation), latitude-height or
one-dimensional model. This makes it exceptionally flexible and
applicable to a range of studies, including for example its use as a
radiative-convective model to test a new radiative transfer scheme, or
as a three-dimensional global model to examine wave-mean flow
interactions. It is also easily configured for any planetary atmosphere,
and has so far been applied to the atmospheres of Earth, Mars, Titan and
most recently Venus. We will present an overview of results to date,
including tests of the dynamical core using simplified forcing, Mars
simulations that compare very well with observations, and Mars
simulations using a `rotated’ grid in which the poles are dealt
with particularly well. We will also outline future work using high
resolution `nests’ placed within the global domain to enable
multi-scale feedbacks.

This work is partially funded by NASA's AISR and OPR research programs,
and we would also like to acknowledge our use of Caltech's new 1024 node
Geological and Planetary Sciences Dell cluster, CITerra.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In recent years, there have been at least two broad surveys of dust
devil activity over various regions of Mars (Balme et al., 2003) (Fisher
et al., 2005). The results of these surveys provide useful constraints
for designing and testing new schemes for forecasting Martian dust
devils, in particular their number density and size at a given place and
time. This endeavor would be useful both for future spacecraft
operations and improved dust cycle simulation within Martian general
circulation models. At present, the predominant scheme for dust devil
forecasting is based on Renno et al. (1998), which as presently applied
only gives a relative measure of the maximum incidence of dust devils in
a given area based on thermodynamic considerations and predictions of
their wind velocities etc. In this study, the Mars implementation of the
Planetary Weather Research and Forecasting Model (planetWRF) and the
results of the surveys are used to demonstrate that dust devil formation
is likely more mechanically than thermodynamically controlled. As an
alternative, we propose the existence of one or multiple "nucleation
criteria” for dust devil formation that can be combined with the
well-known size-duration relation for terrestrial dust devils (Sinclair,
1966) in order to forecast number density. We use planetWRF output and
survey data to evaluate various nucleation criteria based on: (1)
inhibition of convection by near-surface mechanical turbulence
(Deardorff, 1972); (2) inhibition or enhancement of convection by
mesoscale to synoptic scale wind systems; and (3) the possibility of the
dust devil's rotation inhibiting its own convective support within the
near-surface superadiabatic layer. This work is supported in part by
NASA. The numerical simulations for this research were performed on
Caltech's CITerra cluster.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>TitanWRF is the Titan version of the PlanetWRF model, which is a global,
planetary version of the mesoscale, Earth-based WRF (Weather Research
and Forecasting) model (www.wrf-model.org). It uses a full radiative
transfer scheme (a more recent version of that described in McKay,
Pollack and Courtin, "The Thermal Structure of Titan's Atmosphere",
Icarus 1989) including diurnal and seasonal variations in solar forcing,
and is fully three-dimensional allowing waves and their effect on the
mean flow to be represented explicitly. This required us to use a
computationally efficient model - Titan's thick sluggish atmosphere has
very long dynamical time-scales, and a Titan year is  30 Earth years,
meaning that long simulations are needed to `spin up’ the model
atmosphere. PlanetWRF was therefore an excellent choice, as its basis
(the WRF model) was designed to run efficiently on parallel machines,
such as the new 1024 node Geological and Planetary Sciences Dell
cluster, CITerra, available to us at Caltech.

We will present results from the latter stages of model spin-up, and
show that the model atmosphere (having been started from rest) takes
many Titan years to reach an equilibrium state in which there is no net
transfer of angular momentum from surface to atmosphere when averaged
over one year. We will also show that our model begins to produce
significant equatorial super-rotation after several years, and will
identify the mechanism behind this in TitanWRF. Validation of the
equilibrium model state is our next step once it is available, but we
will also outline future plans after this has been accomplished. These
include allowing advection of the radiatively active haze distribution
by model winds, and the inclusion of simple methane microphysics to
study cloud formation in Titan's lower atmosphere.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The NCAR terrestrial Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric
model has been converted into a global, planetary model. The model is
fully compressible, has Coriolis and curvature treatment and has
hydrostratic and non-hydrostatic options.

The model has been converted for use on Venus, initally using the
linearized forcing and dissipation parameterizations of recent Venus
GCMs (Lee et al.(2005), Yamamoto and Takahashi (2003)). Preliminary
analysis of the momentum transports, atmospheric circulation, and
super-rotation diagnostics from this model will be presented.

The next stage of the study will be to use more realistic thermal
forcing data derived from radiative models, and to adapt a radiative
transfer model for the Venus atmosphere in order to provide more
realistic heating rates and allow radiative feedback processes to be
included in the GCM.
