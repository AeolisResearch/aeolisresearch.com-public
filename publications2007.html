<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>High-resolution observations of atmospheric phenomena by the Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) during
its first mapping year are presented. An atmospheric campaign was implemented on the basis of previous spacecraft imaging.
This campaign, however, proved of limited success. This appears to be due to the late local time of the Odyssey orbit (the
locations of activity at 4 6 p.m. appear to be different from those at 2 p.m.). Ironically, images targeting the surface were
more useful for study of the atmosphere than those images specifically targeting atmospheric features. While many previously
recognized features were found, novel THEMIS observations included persistent clouds in the southern polar layered deposits,
dust or condensate plumes on the northern polar layered deposits, dust plumes as constituent parts of local dust storms, and
mesospheric clouds. The former two features tend to be aligned parallel and normal to polar troughs, respectively, suggesting
a wind system directed normal to troughs and radially outward from the center of the polar deposits. This is consistent with
katabatic drainage of air off the polar deposits, analogous to flow off Antarctica. The observation of dust lifting plumes
at unprecedented resolution associated with local dust storms not only demonstrates the importance of mean wind stresses (as
opposed to dust devils) in initiation of dust storms, but is also seen to be morphologically identical to dust lifting in
terrestrial dust storms. As Odyssey moves to earlier local times, we suggest that the atmospheric campaign from the first
mapping year be repeated.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>General circulation models (GCMs) of the Venus atmosphere are currently forced using only simplified parameterizations of
the radiative forcing and boundary conditions, such as those discussed in Yamamoto and Takahashi (JAS, 2003) or Lee, Lewis
and Read (JGR, 2007). Using these parameterizations, suitable dynamical cores produce a qualitatively realistic circulation
with super-rotation and transient planetary waves. The quantitative accuracy of the GCMs varies with dynamical core and the
particular numerical parameterizations employed. However, all current GCMs exhibit sensitivity to the numerical parameterizations
used to describe the behavior of the boundary conditions and the sub grid-scale eddy activity. These parameterizations are
often used to reduce the grid-scale noise and unwanted propagating waves caused by discretization in the models We discuss
the response of the numerical cores used in a number of simplified Venus GCMs using their various boundary layer and sub grid-scale
parameterizations, and forcing with the radiative parameterizations outlined in Lee, Lewis and Read (JGR, 2007). The numerical
cores tested include the PlanetWRF model (Caltech/NCAR), FMS (GFDL/NOAA) and HadAM3 (Oxford/Hadley Centre). We also discuss
a possible physical interpretation of the sensitivities we have investigated and suggest corrections to the parameterizations
used in these simplified GCMs. These corrections should provide more physically reasonable parameterizations for the thick
Venus atmosphere, and in turn reduce the sensitivity to the numerical parameterizations such as the horizontal hyper-diffusion
used to damp grid-scale waves, or the Rayleigh friction used to damp vertically propagating waves.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Recent comparisons of global snap-shots of Mars' surface taken by the Viking and Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) cameras have been
used to suggest that Mars has darkened, and hence has warmed, between the 1970's and 1990's. While this conclusion is not
supported by more quantitative analysis of albedo data, the idea of Martian darkening and warming has found its way into the
terrestrial climate change debate. Through blogs and other opinion pieces it has been used, both amusingly and disturbingly,
to argue that Mars' apparent natural warming should alleviate our concerns about anthropomorphic climate change on Earth.
Relating planetary research results to terrestrial analogs is instructive and promotes public understanding, but this example
provides a cautionary tale of misinterpretation in this age of politicized science. The dust cycle is the dominant short-term
component of the Martian climate. The atmosphere is strongly forced via dust's modification of atmospheric radiative heating
rates, while dust loading displays dramatic interannual variability, from background opacity to aperiodic global dust storms.
Until recently, the atmospheric component of the dust cycle was better documented than the surface component (which on Mars
can be gauged via albedo). But now thanks to the combination of regional imaging, spot thermal infrared spectra, and spot
short-wavelength photometry sampled at synoptic time and length scales by MGS, a rich new view of the relationship between
specific meteorological phenomena and the patterns of surface dust is emerging. Seasonal cap winds, local, regional, and global
dust storms, and monsoonal circulations all redistribute surface dust on large spatial scales, while dust devils are surprisingly
shown to be insignificant. Rapid and widespread albedo modification is accomplished by storms that darken relatively bright
regions through dust removal, and deposit dust upon largely dust free areas, brightening them. (It is not possible with existing
data to infer dust deposition or erosion in perennially dusty areas.) However, most of the dust deposited on darker regions
is removed within one Martian year. This rapid cleaning suggests that darker areas retain their dust-free albedo over decadal
time scales because any dust deposited there can be eroded at commonly experienced wind speeds. Bright regions recover more
slowly, sometimes requiring several martian years. The depletion of these dust sources in some years may play an important
role in the interannual variability in dust storm occurrence and intensity by introducing a multiyear "memory" into the system.
The observation of the 2001 global storm and its wake allows predictions to be made for the recovery following the 2007 global
storm: the southern hemisphere should retain a transient brightening until after the seasonal cap has advanced and retreated.
The MGS data show that albedo is a dynamic and evolving meteorologically and climatologically active variable, not a static
boundary condition. Overall, the major story that albedo has to tell is one of major dust storms and recovery from them &amp;150;
not of secular changes &amp;150; and that the changes are mostly cyclic such that surfaces tend to return to their pre-storm albedos.
We speculate that this system of fine balances is dynamically controlled, such that interannual occurrence of dust storms
and the partial dust coating of the surface should be robust against the expected large changes of orbital parameters throughout
Martian geological history.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We model the variation of non-condensable trace gases that results from the seasonal cycle of CO2 on Mars. A simple condensation
scheme has been incorporated into MarsWRF, a 3-dimensional numerical model for the atmospheres of Mars. Non-condensable trace
gas (mostly N2 and Ar) mass mixing ratios are affected by the phase change of CO2 and by transport. The distribution of Ar
abundance has been observed by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on the Mars 2001 Odyssey spacecraft. We are able to qualitatively
reproduce the Ar observations, including the seasonal evolving latitudinal distribution. However, the modeled magnitudes of
maximum enrichment are lower than observed. Smoothing Ar enrichment in the vertical reduces susceptibility to transport by
near-surface, off-cap circulation, therefore gives further enhancement of non-condensable tracer in the winter pole. We suggest
that a missing process in the model may account for the underestimation. An extra buoyancy term in the dynamics should result
from the vertical gradient in mean molecular mass as Ar mass mixing ratio increases.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Quantitative study of Mars weather and climate will ultimately stem from analysis of its dynamic and thermodynamic fields.
Of all the observations of Mars available to date, such fields are most easily derived from mapping data (radiances) of the
martian atmosphere as measured by orbiting infrared spectrometers and radiometers (e.g., MGS / TES and MRO / MCS).  Such data-derived
products are the solutions to inverse problems, and while individual profile retrievals have been the popular data-derived
products in the planetary sciences, the terrestrial meteorological community has gained much ground over the last decade by
employing techniques of data assimilation (DA) to analyze radiances. Ancillary information is required to close an inverse
problem (i.e., to disambiguate the family of possibilities that are consistent with the observations), and DA practitioners
inevitably rely on numerical models for this information (e.g., general circulation models (GCMs)). Data assimilation elicits
maximal information content from available observations, and, by way of the physics encoded in the numerical model, spreads
this information spatially, temporally, and across variables, thus allowing global extrapolation of limited and non-simultaneous
observations.  If the model is skillful, then a given, specific model integration can be corrected by the information spreading
abilities of DA, and the resulting time sequence of "analysis" states are brought into agreement with the observations.  These
analysis states are complete, gridded estimates of all the fields one might wish to diagnose for scientific study of the martian
atmosphere.  Though a numerical model has been used to obtain these estimates, their fidelity rests in their simultaneous
consistency with both the observations (to within their stated uncertainties) and the physics contained in the model.  In
this fashion, radiance observations can, say, be used to deduce the wind field. A new class of DA approaches based on Monte
Carlo approximations, "ensemble-based methods," has matured  enough to be both appropriate for use in planetary problems and
exploitably within the reach of planetary scientists.  Capitalizing on this new class of methods, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has  developed a framework for ensemble-based DA that is flexible and modular in its use of various
forecast models  and data sets.  The framework is called DART, the Data Assimilation Research Testbed, and it is freely available
on-line.  We have begun to take advantage of this rich software infrastructure, and are on our way toward performing state
of the art DA in the martian atmosphere using Caltech's martian general circulation model, PlanetWRF. We have begun by testing
and validating the model within DART under idealized scenarios, and we hope to address actual, available infrared remote sensing
datasets from Mars orbiters in the coming year.  We shall present the details of this approach and our progress to date.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We will present results from multi-annual simulations of methane
condensation in the troposphere of Titan, using the global version of
the TitanWRF atmospheric model. TitanWRF is the Titan version of the
PlanetWRF model (Richardson et al., 2007, JGR, in press). PlanetWRF
differs from the model upon which it is based, NCAR's Weather Research
and Forecasting model (www.wrf-model.org), in that it (a) can be run in
global as well as limited area mode, and (b) is structured to be easily
adapted to planets other than the Earth.

The methane condensation scheme includes for example (i) a surface
source, depending on the sub-saturation of the lowest atmospheric layer
and the strength of near-surface winds, as in Tokano et al. (2001,
Icarus, 153, 130-147); (ii) determination of the type of condensate
produced (methane ice or a binary liquid including dissolved nitrogen)
depending on temperature; (iii) inclusion of a decrease in saturation
vapor pressure for the binary liquid; (iv) different assumptions about
the fate of any condensate produced.

Preliminary results show some interesting similarities to the observed
location and timing of Titan clouds, and suggest further investigations
which will also be discussed.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Since the work of Eden and Vonnegut (1973, Science, 180, 962-963), it has been hypothesized that the lower atmosphere of Mars
might be highly electrically active during dusty conditions. This electrical activity supposedly results from the charging
of dust and sand particles by collisions with other dust and sand particles of contrasting size and/or composition and the
discharge of these particles into an atmosphere with a low breakdown potential. Farrell et al. (1999, JGR, 104, 3795-3801)
and Renno et al. (2003, GRL, 30, 2140) have proposed that these electrical discharges might be a source of intense non-thermal
radiation and therefore detectable.

In this work, we synthesize the work of Farrell et al. (1999) and Renno et al. (2003) into a model of non-thermal radiation
(primarily UHF) produced by emission from arc discharges between sand and dust particles. Although this model is highly unconstrained,
it can provide insight into the source characteristics of such radiation. We use this model to analyze the observations of
Busch et al. (this meeting) and consider the implications of our analysis for surface spacecraft operations, enhancement of
dust lifting by strong electric fields (Kok and Renno, 2006, GRL, 33, L19S10), meteorological monitoring, and lower atmosphere
chemical synthesis on Mars (Atreya et al., 2006, Astrobiology, 6, 439).

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Several authors have suggested that martian dust storms should produce radio emission from electrostatic discharges between
dust grains (e.g. Farrell et al. 1999, JGR 104, 3795-3801; Renno et al. 2003, GRL 30, 2140). We report results from ongoing
VLA observations of Mars at L-band (20 cm). With the VLA in A-configuration (35 km maximum baseline), we resolve Mars and
can compare the pattern of radio emission to the expected thermal flux and the positions of known dust storms.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A new planetary atmospheric numerical model, “planetWRF,” has been developed by modifying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The model has generalized map projection, multiscale, and nesting capabilities, blurring the distinction between global and mesoscale models and enabling investigation of coupling between processes on all scales, including global. The model can also be run in one, two, or three dimensions. The conversion of the dynamical core for global application by altering the map projection grid and the boundary conditions as well as conversion of the physics parameterizations and constants for planetary application are described. Validation of the global dynamical core through use of standard forcing scenarios is presented. Example results from a series of simulations for Mars, Titan, and Venus are shown to demonstrate that the model performs well for a variety of planets and operating modes (microscale, mesoscale, and global scale).</td>
