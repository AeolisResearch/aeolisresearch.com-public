<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This study has focused on the development and application of the first
fully three-dimensional model of the current Mars water cycle. Previous
models of the water cycle have suggested the importance of transport
processes in determining the observed variations in atmospheric water
[Jakosky and Haberle (1992)]. This work addresses questions regarding
the relative importance of water reservoirs, transport of water, control
of global average vapour amounts, and the importance of clouds. The
results of this work show that model transport out of the northern polar
region during summer occurs primarily in surface forced, zonally
asymmetric currents. Significantly more hemispheric transport is
predicted than expected with zonal average models. Transport capacity is
higher for south to north flow during southern summer than for north to
south flow in northern summer. Houben et al. (1997) suggested that a
model without regolith would ``flood'' with vapour. Our model does riot
show this behaviour, thus the regolith may not provide sole control over
global vapour amounts. The mechanism of ``equilibration'' for the model
without regolith pivots on an annual average vapour flux balance across
the northern high-latitude/polar latitude boundary. However, as there is
always net loss to the south polar cold tap the ``equilibrium'' is only
approximate. Simulations suggest that an exposed southern water cap
would be unstable with respect to the northern cap. Comparison with
zonal-average vapour data suggests that the residual cap provides &lt;=
40% of the vapour observed to accrue after L S = 80Â°.
Simulations employing seasonal ice show improved ``fits,'' but
additional (regolith) sources are needed. As suggested by Kahn (1990),
agreement with data requires cloud ice precipitation. Precipitation
allows water to be removed from a cold atmosphere more rapidly than
diffusion of ice or vapour. Simulations also suggest that cloud
formation may reduce interhemispheric water transport [Clancy et al.
(1996)]. The model evolution of zonal-average vapour distributions is in
rough agreement with data. Cloudiness is generally overpredicted, likely
due to defects in the cloud microphysics scheme. The spatial
distribution of clouds compare reasonably well with the limited
observations, however errors do occur in the tropics and winter
hemisphere. These likely result from errors in the vertical wind field
and local scale vapour transport. Differences between the true and model
topography and surface temperatures are the most likely causes. Detailed
modeling of vapour transport will require very close attention to the
surface prescription.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data provide the foundation for
much of our current knowledge of the present Martian climate. The IRTM
data, which were collected over a period in excess of two Mars years,
contain a wealth of information on the spatial and temporal variation of
surface and atmospheric temperatures on diurnal to seasonal time scales.
The 15 micron channel is of particular interest for atmospheric studies
as it was designed to measure brightness temperatures (T15) within a
deep layer of atmosphere centered at roughly 0.5 mb ( 25 km). Our
re-examination of the T15 data suggests that the 15 micron channel was
sensitive to surface radiance to an extent that the air temperature
measurements are significantly biased. This bias is suggested by the
strong correlation between the diurnal variation of tropical surface and
T15 temperatures (for non-dust storm conditions). Atmospheric thermal
tide modeling provides a basis for distinguishing between the surface
and atmospheric contributions to the T15 observations. We use this
approach to estimate the surface radiance contribution, which may then
be removed from the T15 signal, allowing the atmospheric temperature
signal to be recovered. We propose that midday, tropical T15
temperatures 'corrected' in this manner are over 15 K cooler than the
IRTM observations. This suggestion is supported by a comparison of IRTM
data with Mariner 9 IRIS data. Further, 'correcting' global average IRTM
temperatures accounts for the instrumental bias found to exist between
simultaneous IRTM and microwave observations. We will present a
description of the revised T15 temperatures and discuss aspects of the
martian circulation and climate which are highlighted by a consideration
of the reprocessed observations.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This paper presents the first comparison of simultaneous Viking infrared
and ground-based microwave measurements of the Martian atmosphere. The
data are examined in order to investigate a 15-20 K difference between
microwave and Viking measurements of mid-level (10-40 km) air
temperature. These data have been used by Clancy et al. (1990) to
suggest that the Martian atmosphere is generally cooler and clearer than
observed during the Viking era. This study suggests that the 15-20 K
difference, which is most apparent during the non-'dust-storm' seasons,
is not a real temperature difference, but instead results from a
disagreement between the measurement techniques. The existence of this
instrumental bias implies that the Martian climate has not substantially
changed since the Viking era.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Martian water cycle is highly asymmetric with regard to season.
Spacecraft and telescopic observations show peak column water vapour
abundances over the northern summer high latitudes ( ~ 90prmu m) with
the southern summer peak being smaller ( ~ 20prmu m) and appearing
further from the pole. This distribution of vapour results in an annual
average meridional vapour gradient whose means of maintenance has yet to
be conclusively determined (Jakosky and Haberle, 1992). Hypotheses thus
advanced include a net annual transfer of water from north to south,
more vigorous meridional transport during southern summer (Davies 1981,
James 1985), and trapping of vapour in the northern summer hemisphere by
the circulation (Haberle and Jakosky 1990), water condensation (Clancy
{et} {al.} 1996), or subsurface adsorption (Houben {et} {al.} 1997). The
GFDL Mars General Circulation Model (Wilson and Hamilton 1996 and Wilson
{et} {al.} 1997, this volume) has been augmented with water processes
including: atmospheric water vapour transport, water exchange with
surface ice, atmospheric vapour condensation, and subsurface water
exchange. This model represents the first treatment of the water cycle
in a full General Circulation Model including the effects of topography,
diurnal cycle, and interactive atmospheric dust. Results will be shown
from model experiments designed to assess the ability of the atmosphere
to extract water from the north polar cap source and effect equatorward
transport. The role of atmospheric vapour condensation in limiting the
transport of water, its effect on the spatial distribution of dust (via
the use of dust for water condensation nuclei), and consequently its
influence on the vigour of circulation (by altering the amount of solar
radiation absorbed by airborne dust) will be examined.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Observations of the martian atmosphere reveal a strong annual modulation
of atmospheric temperature that is evidently due to the pronounced
seasonal asymmetry in solar radiation and the highly variable
distribution of aerosol. The implied variations in thermal forcing are
closely coupled to the character and vigor of the atmospheric general
circulation through the raising and transport dust. The GFDL Mars GCM
has been developed to investigate the interaction between thermal
forcing and the atmospheric circulation, most notably the Hadley
circulation and the thermal tides (Wilson and Hamilton, 1996). Using a
prescribed aerosol source in the bottom atmospheric layer, the model
self-consistently calculates aerosol transport and radiative heating.
For example, with a sufficiently rapid injection of aerosol into the
atmosphere, a realistic simulation of the 1977b global dust storm and
associated winter polar warming may be obtained (Wilson, 1997). Sources
and sinks of water vapor and condensate and their transport have also
been incorporated in the GCM in order to explore arguments (Clancy et
al. 1996) that the water vapor distribution may play a role in
establishing and maintaining a relatively clear and cold atmosphere
during the Northern hemisphere summer season. Simulations indicate that
inclusion of possible radiative and sedimentation effects of
water-ice-coated dust can have a significant interactive effect on the
aerosol and temperature distribution in the martian tropical region. We
will present results for a variety of dust source scenarios which
illustrate the role of aerosol in the martian climate.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>How the Martian atmosphere transports heat, dust, and water into the
polar air column is likely to affect the development of the polar
layered terrains, growth of the seasonal polar caps, optical properties
of the polar caps, and partitioning of CO2 condensation between the
atmosphere and surface. It has been known for some time that the vigour
of the large scale circulation and transport into the polar air mass are
related to the amount of dust suspended in the atmosphere. During
periods of low dust loading, the Hadley circulation terminates well
short of the polar regions and a strong, isolating polar jet vortex
develops along the polar front. When dust increases, the Hadley cell
expands and eddy transports increase. However, until recently it has not
proven possible to simulate the most dramatic episode in observed polar
meteorology: the polar warming following the second global dust storm of
1977. Model improvements have now allowed simulation of this event in
the NASA Ames GCM (Haberle et al. 1996 - companion abstract). The
ability of the Ames GCM to emulate the observed polar warming increases
confidence in the fidelity of the model during periods of high dust
loading. We will present analysis of model output for varying dust
loading configurations. In particular we will illustrate variations in
the heat transport associated with the mean circulation, and stationary
and transient eddies; variations in the amount and location of
atmospheric condensation; and the results of tracer transport studies
using an aerosol model coupled to the GCM. We will also examine the
simulated 1977 polar warming in order to compare with the Viking
observations of atmospheric temperature and dust transport.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Atmospheric condensation of CO_2 is a critical but poorly understood
part of the Martian seasonal CO_2 cycle. During polar night, the latent
heat released by CO_2 condensation is the major heat source, and CO2
clouds can substantially reduce the infrared emission from the
condensing seasonal CO_2 polar cap. The CO_2 snow which precipitates
from the atmosphere may also help determine the radiative and physical
characteristics of the seasonal CO_2 polar caps, depending on the
relative amount of condensation which takes place in the atmosphere.
Previous models of atmospheric CO_2 condensation on Mars have not taken
into account the finite rates of nucleation, growth, and sedimentation,
or the radiative effects of the CO_2 clouds themselves, and their
results may be inconsistent with available data. In order to address
these issues, we have developed a one-dimensional model of the growth
and precipitation of CO_2 snow in the polar night atmosphere of Mars.
The model includes a realistic treatment of the microphysical processes
of heat and mass transfer in both the continuum and free molecular
regimes, as well as the transition region. We have also taken into
account surface kinetics, or the finite rate at which molecules can be
incorporated into the crystal lattice. We will present model
calculations of snow particle growth and sedimentation rates for
different values of atmospheric supersaturation and nucleation height.
These results are compared with Viking IRTM observations to place
constraints on the amount of atmospheric condensation. We will also
present predictions of what TES and MOLA will see on Mars Global
Surveyor.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Global dust opacity mapping for Mars has been carried forward using the
approach described by Martin (1986) for Viking IR Thermal Mapper data.
New maps are presented for the period from the beginning of Viking
observations, until Ls 210 deg in 1979 (1.36 Mars years). This range
includes the second and more extensive planet-encircling dust storm
observed by Viking, known as storm 1977b. Improvements in approach
result in greater time resolution and smaller noise than in the earlier
work. A strong local storm event filled the Hellas basin at Ls 170 deg,
prior to the 1977a storm. Dust is retained in equatorial regions
following the 1977b storm far longer than in mid-latitudes. Minor dust
events appear to raise the opacity in northern high latitudes during
northern spring. Additional mapping with high time resolution has been
done for the periods of time near the major storm origins in order to
search for clues to the mechanism of storm initiation. The first
evidence of the start of the 1977b storm is pushed back to Ls 274.2 deg,
preceding signs of the storm in images by about 15 hours.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A series of infrared thermal mapper (IRTM) south polar brightness
temperature maps obtained by Viking Orbiter 2 during a 35-day period
during the southern fall season in 1978 was examined. The maps show a
number of phenomena that have been identified in previous studies,
including day to day brightness temperature variations in individual low
temperature regions and the tendency for IRTM 11-micron channel
brightness temperatures to also decrease in regions where low 20-micron
channel brightness temperatures are observed. The maps also show new
phenomena, the most striking of which is a clear tendency for the low
brightness temperature regions to occur at fixed geographic regions.
During this season, the coldest low brightness temperatures appear to be
concentrated in distinct regions, with spatial scales ranging from 50 to
300 km. There are approximately a dozen of these concentrations, with
the largest centered near the location of the south residual polar cap.
Other concentrations are located at Cavi Angusti and close to the
craters Main, South, Lau, and Dana. Broader, less intense regions appear
to be well correlated with the boundaries of the south polar layered
deposits and the Mountains of Mitchell. No evidence for horizontal
motion of any of these regions has been detected.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Mapping of dust opacity of the Martian atmosphere, using the
silicate-induced absorption of 9 micron radiation, was performed with
the Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data for several local dust
storms and in a global sense. We present here the first results from an
effort to extend the earlier mapping work to the period of the 1977b
major storm, and to concentrate attention on the details of opacity
behavior during the initial phases of the 1977a and b storms.
