<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Titan WRF is a new three-dimensional model for the atmosphere of Titan,
and is a globalized, `Titan'-ified version of the Earth-based, mesoscale
`Weather Research and Forecasting' model. Titan WRF thus inherits all of
the desirable features from the original model, including highly
parallelized and accurate code (ideal for the long simulations required
here) and the ability to place high resolution nests within lower
resolution domains (thus study certain areas in high detail without the
expense of running the entire model at this resolution). Unlike the
original mesoscale version of WRF, however, Titan WRF does not require
forcing from a separate model. Our eventual aim is to use Titan WRF to
study the onset and evolution of methane clouds in Titan's atmosphere,
although initially we are concerned with producing and validating the
modeled atmosphere and its seasonal changes, first with a constant haze
distribution (varying with height only) then with advection of
radiatively-active haze within the atmosphere. We will present the first
results for each season of a Titan year, as simulated by Titan WRF (with
a constant haze distribution) following several years during which the
model atmosphere is allowed to `spin up' due to contact and exchange of
angular momentum with the surface. These results will include zonal mean
winds (including a discussion of the amount of equatorial superrotation
produced), temperatures and mass streamfunctions for different seasons.
We will compare these with available observations, then discuss our
future plans.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Spacecraft data increasingly suggest that Mars has experienced dramatic
changes in the distribution of surface and subsurface  water ice in the
recent past, potentially associated with rather different climate
states.  In the limit of high obliquity, this likely corresponds to
tropical water ice sheets, while in the low obliquity limit, it
corresponds to atmospheric collapse.  Climate models suggest that such
changes in the planetary environment and water distribution are expected
on the basis of the large change in planetary orbital parameters on time
scales &gt;10{5} yrs.  These variations are quazi-cyclical, and so are
expected to have caused ongoing (non-secular) changes in climate
throughout the Amazonian. Indeed, some orbital forcing of climate may be
involved in the episodes of raised and lowered water table in Terra
Meridiani,  as inferred from Opportunity observations.  It is believed
that superposed on this quazi-cyclical pattern is a signal of net
atmospheric deflation, due primarily to loss to space.  The challenge
for climate dynamics is to explain the nature and extent of climate
change through time, with a particular focus on the changing
distribution and stability of water.  This presentation will review
developments to date, model sensitivities, and future directions.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We consider the impact of orbital cycling (obliquity, eccentricity,
perihelion precession) on the martian atmospheric water cycle through
recent Amazonian  history.  Changes in obliquity from present-day values
can have a significant effect on the abundance of water vapor in the
martian atmosphere.  In addition, the magnitude and distribution of
surface water ice deposits can vary significantly, on timescales
commensurate with the period of obliquity oscillation (100 ky). We have
used results from both the GFDL Mars GCM as well as the Planetary WRF
GCM to examine possible changes in the water cycle induced by these
orbital motions.  Preliminary results indicate that if a sublimation lag
develops over extant polar deposits during an extended rise to high
obliquity (105-106 yr), the amount of water vapor released into the
atmosphere  will be correspondingly and significantly reduced,
maintained in balance with any ice deposits that developed in the lower
latitudes prior to the ``shutting off'' of the polar ice deposits. Under
these conditions, annual average water abundances at high obliquity may
only be 20-80 prμm, one to two orders of magnitude less than previous
estimates, and only a factor of a few higher than present-day values. 
Further, the ``wettest'' periods in recent Mars history may not be
directly correlated with the highest mean obliquity but rather with
brief periods of high obliquity when the mean obliquity was only
slightly higher than present.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Although Mars Odyssey's Thermal Emission Imaging System visible
subsystem (THEMIS-VIS) was not designed or intended for stereo imaging
or cloud tracking, its multiple exposure color-imaging sequence
serendipitously causes a parallax effect that allows the height of
high-altitude clouds to be determined, and has sufficient time delay to
detect the movement of these clouds.   As a result, THEMIS-VIS has
acquired exceptionally high resolution (36 or 72 m pixel scale)
nadir-pointed images of  martian clouds with altitudes in the 60-80 km
altitude range, and is providing the first direct measurements of wind
speed at these altitudes. We discover high altitude cloud candidates by
noticing a severe misalignment of cloud features between any two bands
of an image which has been map-projected at the altitude of the local
surface.  In order to measure altitude and velocity, we reproject the
subframes that make up a THEMIS-VIS image at a series altitudes above
the local surface, shifting the subframes  relative to each other to
account for a range of candidate velocities.  To select the best fitting
altitude and velocity, we  manually inspect the reprojected images to
find an approximate solution, and then maximize the correlation between
the 425 nm band and 540 nm band within a manually selected
high-constrast cloud-dominated region of the image in order to refine
the solution.  The precision of this technique is of course inherently
limited by the sharpness of the cloud features. To date we have obtained
two high-altitude velocity measurements, and have identified 50 more
images with high altitude clouds that are likely to yield velocity
measurements.  In THEMIS sequence number V06930045, 217 degrees L_s and
47 degrees  north latitude, we measure eastward cloud motion of 60 +/-
15 m/s at an altitude of 70 +/- 5 km.   In THEMIS sequence number
V10526009, 26 degrees L_s and 0.5 degrees north latitude, we measure
westward cloud motion of 90 +/- 20 m/s at an altitude  of 80 +/- 5 km.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Some big questions relating to Titan's atmosphere are: How much
equatorial superrotation occurs? What determines the way in which albedo
patterns change over time at different wavelengths? and What determines
the size, frequency and location of the recently observed southern
hemisphere clouds?

To investigate such questions properly requires a three-dimensional
model of Titan's thick atmosphere, which can examine different scenarios
in multi-year simulations. Such simulations are computationally
demanding due to Titan's long radiative and seasonal timescales, as well
as its slow rotation rate, all of which mean a long time is required to
spin up then conduct each run. This demands the use of an efficient,
accurate, and mass- and momentum-conserving model.

One such model is the newly developed Planetary Weather Research and
Forecasting model (PWRF), which is based on a pre-existing terrestrial
mesoscale model (WRF). WRF is a highly parallelized and numerically
efficient model, which is also able to place high resolution 'nests'
(with information passing both inwards and outwards) over selected
regions where resolving small-scale features is most necessary. This is
very useful, as increasing the resolution everywhere would slow the
model considerably. PWRF retains these features, but extends to using a
global mother domain (no separate global model required), and has also
been adapted to include a planetary timing system (using areocentric
longitude) and other planetary options (such as radiation schemes).

We will present results from the Titan version of PWRF to demonstrate
how well the model reproduces key aspects of Titan's circulation (e.g.
superrotation, temperature structure). We will describe our plans to
include aerosol transport, and our eventual aim to model the recently
observed (telescopically from Earth, e.g. Griffith et al. Nature 1998,
Brown et al. Nature 2002, and from Cassini, e.g. Porco et al. Nature
2005) methane clouds.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The variation of water vapour near the Martian surface will be
influenced by exchange with the subsurface, condensation on the surface
and in the atmosphere, mixing between the boundary layer and the free
atmosphere, and the large-scale horizontal mixing of air masses. In
order to isolate column processes from those of transport, we have
developed a "complete" model of column water cycling based around a
one-dimensional version of the Martian Weather Research and Forecast
(WRF) model. Explicitly treated processes include subsurface water
diffusion and adsorptive/condensational exchange, surface ice formation,
diffusive mixing in the atmosphere, and the microphysics of atmospheric
cloud/fog formation and sedimentation. The formation of surface ices and
clouds/fogs allow for the activation of feedback systems due to their
influence on the radiative heating of the surface and hence the surface
energy balance and temperature. The model is used to assess the
variation of cloud/fog vertical structure and water vapour at likely
Phoenix and MSL landing sites (for which fog and water vapour
measurements, respectively, are planned for collection). The implication
of cloud radiative effects for retrieval of surface thermal properties
will also be discussed.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>This presentation will describe the progress to-date on the development
of an acoustic anemometer for the in-situ measurement of wind speeds on
Mars, funded by NASA PIDDP. Improved measurements of Martian winds are
needed for several reasons: better prediction and understanding of
global and regional weather, direct measurement of fluxes between
surface/atmosphere of momentum, heat, and trace atmospheric
constituents, characterizing and monitoring boundary layer winds that
influence the safe delivery of spacecraft to/from the Martian surface,
and improved characterization of geologically important aeolian
processes that can pose a hazard to future exploration via dust storms
and dust devils.

Prior attempts to measure surface winds have been limited in capability
and difficult to calibrate. Sonic anemometry, measuring wind speed via
sound pulse travel-time differences, can overcome many of these issues.
Sonic anemometry has several distinct advantages over other methods such
as hot wire techniques: higher sensitivity ( &lt;5 cm/s), higher time
resolution (10-100 Hz), and fewer intrinsic biases for improved
accuracy. Together, these open the possibility of resolving turbulent
boundary layer eddies to directly capture surface-to-atmospheric fluxes
for the first time.

We will describe the results of our development of an acoustic
anemometer using capacitive micro-machined devices, optimized for
acoustic coupling in a low-pressure medium like the Martian atmosphere.
This development includes transducer characterization tests in a
pressure chamber at Ball Aerospace with Mars-relevant CO2 pressures. We
will also describe experimental results showing that the addition of
water in a low-pressure CO2 atmosphere can significantly increase
acoustic attenuation. Finally we will describe plans for further
optimization of the instrument for future Mars payloads.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We have compiled a catalog of frontal dust storms in the northern
hemisphere using Mars Orbiter Camera daily global maps spanning ~2.3
Martian years of Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) observations (from 1999 to
2003). The most vigorous frontal storms that flush dust to the low
latitudes occur in early-mid fall and mid-late winter, away from the
northern winter solstice. While many streaks are observed in the polar
hood during the winter solstice period, no frontal dust storms are
observed in the vicinity of the north polar region. We have also
analyzed simultaneous MGS Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES)
temperature data and found statistically significant negative
temperature anomalies associated with frontal storms. In the lowest
scale height of the atmosphere, the geographical and seasonal
distributions of temperature standard deviations associated with
transient variations agree well with the distributions of frontal
storms. The correlation deteriorates with increasing altitude,
suggesting that lower-level temperature waves are associated with the
frontal dust storms. Specifically, eastward traveling m = 3 waves with
periods of 2-3 sols appear to be closely related to the development of
flushing frontal storms.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Both atmospheric modeling and spacecraft imagery of Mars are now of
sufficient quality that the two can be used in conjunction to acquire an
understanding of regional- and local-scale aeolian processes on Mars. We
apply a mesoscale atmospheric model adapted for use on Mars (the Mars
MM5) to Proctor Crater, a 150 km diameter crater in the southern
highlands. Proctor Crater contains numerous aeolian features that
indicate wind direction, including a large dark dune field with
reversing transverse and star dunes containing three different slipface
orientations, small and older bright bedforms that are most likely
transverse granule ripples, and seasonally erased dust devil tracks.
Results from model runs spanning a Martian year, with a horizontal grid
spacing of 10 km, predict winds aligned with two of the three dune
slipfaces as well as spring and summer winds matching the dust devil
track orientations. The primary (most prevalent) dune slipface
orientation corresponds to a fall and winter westerly wind created by
geostrophic forces. The tertiary dune slipface orientation is caused by
spring and summer evening katabatic flows down the eastern rim of the
crater, influencing only the eastern portion of the crater floor. The
dunes are trapped in the crater because the tertiary winds, enhanced by
topography, counter transport from the oppositely oriented primary
winds, which may have originally carried sand into the crater. The dust
devil tracks are caused by light spring and summer westerly winds during
the early afternoon caused by planetary rotation. The secondary dune
slipface orientation is not predicted by model results from either the
Mars MM5 or the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Mars general
circulation model. The reason for this is not clear, and the wind
circulation pattern that creates this dune slipface is not well
constrained. The Mars MM5 model runs do not predict stresses above the
saltation threshold for dune sand of the appropriate size and
composition. As with previous work, the calculated wind velocities are
too low, which may be caused by too large of a grid spacing.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A survey of dust devils using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars
Orbiter Camera (MOC) wide- and narrow-angle (WA and NA) images has been
undertaken. The survey comprises two parts: (1) sampling of nine broad
regions from September 1997 to July 2001 and (2) a focused seasonal
monitoring of variability in the Amazonis region, an active dust devil
site, from March 2001 to April 2004. For part 1, dust devils were
identified in NA and WA images, and dust devil tracks were identified in
NA images. Great spatial variability in dust devil occurrence is
highlighted, with Amazonis Planitia being the most active region
examined. Other active regions included Cimmerium, Sinai, and Solis.
Numerous dust devil tracks, but very few dust devils, were observed in
Casius. This may suggest dust devils here occur at local times other
than that of the MGS orbit (~2 pm). Alternatively, variations in surface
properties may affect the ability of dust devils to leave visible
tracks. The seasonal campaign within Amazonis shows a relatively smooth
variation of dust devil activity with season, peaking in mid northern
summer and falling to zero in southern spring and summer. This pattern
of activity correlates well with the boundary layer maximum depth and
hence the vigor of convection. Global maps of boundary layer depth and
surface temperature do not predict that Amazonis should be especially
active, potentially suggesting a role for mesoscale circulations.
Measurement of observed dust devils yields heights of up to 8 km and
widths in excess of 0.5 km.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Liquid water is not currently stable on the surface of Mars; however,
transient liquid water (ice melt) may occur if the surface temperature
is between the melting and boiling points. Such conditions are met on
Mars with current surface pressures and obliquity due to the large
diurnal range of surface temperatures. This yields the potential for
transient, nonequilibrium liquid water. A general circulation model is
used to undertake an initial exploration of the variation of this
``transient liquid water potential'' (TLWP) for different obliquities
and over a range of increased pressures representing progressively
earlier phases of Martian geological history. At higher obliquities and
slightly higher surface pressures (&lt;50 mbar), TLWP conditions are met
over a very large fraction of the planet. As the surface pressure is
increased above about 50-100 mbar, however, increased atmospheric
thermal blanketing reduces the diurnal surface temperature range,
essentially eliminating the possibility of even transient liquid water.
At high enough pressures, the mean temperature is sufficiently elevated
to allow stable liquid water. Thus the potential for liquid water on
Mars has not decreased monotonically over planetary history as the
atmosphere was lost. Instead, a distinct minimum in TLWP (the ``dead
zone'') will have occurred during the extended period for which
pressures were in the middle range between about 0.1 and 1 bar. This has
direct and restrictive implications for chemical weathering and life.
The fundamental conclusion of this study is largely insensitive to
invocation of brines and to more detailed treatment of atmospheric
radiative processes.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A global dust storm occurred on Mars between June and October 2001. The
storm began near Hellas just before southern spring equinox
(~Ls = 177°). Local storms, likely forced by a
combination of slope-flow and ice cap thermal contrasts, were observed
to propagate along the northwestern rim of Hellas, apparently triggering
the global storm. Cap-edge storm activity for much of late southern
winter was similar in 2001 to one Mars year earlier; however, a very
large storm propagated into the basin just after Ls =
177°. Subsequently, the total area of storm activity in 2001 was
roughly double that of the previous year. For about 10 days, dust
lifting was limited to the Hellas region. As additional storms
propagated into Hellas, activity built and extended northward into
Syrtis and eastward into Hesperia. It is not clear whether transport or
spreading of lifting were of greatest importance for expansion. At
Ls = 185° the storm began to spread rapidly to the east,
along a line from the southern pole to the northern tropics. Essentially
no storm propagation to the west occurred, yielding strong zonal
asymmetry of expansion. As the dust storm reached the western edge of
Tharsis, secondary dust lifting centers developed in Daedalia and Solis
(southeastern Tharsis). Subsequently, the storm rapidly encompassed the
planet (by Ls = 193°). Once fully global, the
Syria/Solis/Daedalia lifting center appeared to dominate (on the basis
of cloud top morphology), with Hellas quiescent. By Ls =
212°, lifting could no longer be discerned. Thereafter, dust haze
appeared uniform and diffuse, and decay appeared to have set in.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>We take a new look at expected atmospheric water vapor abundances on
Mars during periods of high obliquity using the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory Mars General Circulation Model. For the first time,
the sublimation and burial of the present-day residual polar caps
beneath a sublimation lag is considered as the planet shifts from lower
to high (45°) obliquity periods. Following the elimination of the
polar deposits, the only sources for atmospheric water at high obliquity
are the low latitude ice deposits emplaced prior to elimination of the
polar source. Annual average water vapor abundances are predicted to be
only ~20-80 prμm during extended periods of high obliquity, one to
two orders of magnitude less than previous estimates. This has
implications for the climate history of the planet as it suggests that
during extended periods of high obliquity, there is not a significant
greenhouse warming effect from elevated atmospheric water vapor.
