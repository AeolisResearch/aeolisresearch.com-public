<td>The three Martian landers (Mars Pathfinder, Viking Lander 1, and Viking
Lander 2) were able to collect high temporal resolution weather station
data (pressure, temperature, and winds) for three different locations on
the Martian surface. These data sets provide ground-truth against which
modeling efforts can compare themselves. We have developed a new Martian
mesoscale model, the Mars MM5, based upon the Penn State/NCAR Fifth
Generation Mesoscale Model and modified for use with Mars. We will
compare the modeled meteorological variables against those observed by
the landers. We will show that the incorporation of high resolution
topography, albedo, and thermal inertia data allow the mesoscale model
to reproduce the measured atmospheric variables better than a global
circulation model (GCM).

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Martian orbital parameters are known to vary on time scales greater than
105 years. Such variations, especially in obliquity, have
important consequences for the spatial distribution of solar heating of
the surface and atmosphere, and hence are expected to affect some form
of quasi-periodic climate change. The impact of changing obliquity on
surface temperatures, and hence on volatile stability have been widely
addressed. However, the changing insolation patterns should also modify
the circulation of the atmosphere. As the nature and rate of volatile
transport, and the vigour of dust lifting and transport from the surface
are critical aspects of the climate, the circulation response to orbital
variations needs to be assessed. In this presentation, we show results
from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Mars General
Circulation Model (GCM) in which the orbit of Mars has been varied:
obliquities between 0 and 60, perihelion passage between Ls=70 and 250,
and eccentricities between 0 and 0.12. In general, the total atmosphere
and cap CO2 budget is held constant (i.e. we assume no exchange with the
regolith), and that the rate of dust supply into the lowest model level
remains constant. The impact of these assumptions are examined. Many of
the anticipated changes in circulation are found to occur as obliquity
is increased from 0: The Hadley cell strength and that of the winter
polar jet are found to increase; The magnitude of the seasonal CO2 cycle
increases, resulting in extensive seasonal ice caps; Surface winds
strengthen resulting in greater surface stresses and likely stronger
dust lifting; The cycle of water becomes more vigourous, with large
column vapour amounts in the polar regions corresponding to higher cap
surface temperatures. However, some results contrast with expectations:
Although the surface wind strengths change with orbital parameters, the
mean directions tend not to, with implications for aeolian geological
features; Even at low obliquity, the model does not develop a permanent
CO2 ice cap at either pole (this likely reflects the fact that uniform
and non-varying ice properties are gravely inadequate to realistically
simulate Martian polar ices); Water ice deposits do not stabilize at the
equator, even at high obliquity - instead they slosh
backwards-and-forwards between the seasonal ice caps, as they do at
present. We note that the southern summer Hadley circulation remains the
dominant cell when integrated over the annual cycle, even when the
timing of perihelion passage is varied by 180 degrees. We suggest that
this reflects the greater importance of the global topographic dichotomy
for the strength of the mean meridional circulation over that of
eccentricity.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Much of the interest in the polar regions centers on the fact that they
likely contain the best record of Martian climate change on time scales
from years to eons. This expectation is based upon the observed
occurrence of weathering product deposits and volatile reservoirs that
are coupled to the climate. The interpretation of these records requires
an understanding of the exchange of dust, water, and CO2 between the
surface and atmosphere, and the atmospheric redistribution of these
species. Here we discuss a global climate model that incorporates these
elements at some level and will allow examination of the coupling
between polar deposits and global climate systems to begin in earnest.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Lifting of dust requires high near-surface winds. A major problem in
understanding the Mars dust cycle centers on determining the
mechanism(s) generating these winds. Potential mechanisms include
small-scale convective vortices (dust devils), regional slope winds,
albedo and/or thermal inertia contrast (seabreeze) winds, etc. The
retreating edge of the south seasonal polar cap is the observed location
of numerous local dust storms. Therefore the role of the strong
temperature contrast between bare ground and the CO2 ice has long been
suspected of being an important generator of dust-lifting winds. The
acquisition of high quality topography for the south polar regions
allows for the first time simulations of the south polar circulation to
be undertaken. Of equal importance is the availability of
high-resolution atmospheric models and high-speed computing facilities,
which allow the circulation to be inferred from the topographic (and
albedo and thermal inertia) data. Additional information is contained in

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In order to undertake credible studies of the Martian climate at other
epochs, one requirement is a mechanistic understanding of the processes
controlling the water cycle. This need arises from the increasing role
of atmospheric water ice and vapour as radiatively active species as
global atmospheric water abundances increase. Further, a key motivation
for modeling past climates is the need to understand temporal variations
in the amounts, state, and locations of water. We have investigated the
processes controlling the water cycle with the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Mars General Circulation Model (GCM). These
simulations suggest that primary parameters controlling current global
atmospheric water abundance are the albedo and thermal inertia of the
northern residual water ice cap, which in turn will be controlled by the
macro- and microphysical properties of the ice. Additional information
is contained in the original extended abstract.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Exchange of water with the residual water ice cap at the northern pole
is likely the primary mechanism controlling the water cycle and the
global abundance of atmospheric water. The mechanics of this exchange
lie in the mixing of water between the polar airmass immediately
adjacent to the cap and the airmasses at lower latitudes. To date, the
most detailed models of these transport processes have been undertaken
with global three-dimensional models. However, such models are least
valid in these regions due to the topology of their construction. For
example in grid-point models, grid points evenly spaced in longitude
become progressively more tightly packed in physical separation. This
necessitates filtering of dynamical fields, which degrade and modify the
circulation. Mesoscale models represent an improved tool with which to
investigate the polar circulation. They are designed to simulate limited
domains and can be arbitrarily centered, in this case on the pole,
eliminating topological problems common to global models. The only
previous mesoscale study of northern polar water transport is described
by Siili et al., who examined aspects of cap edge water transport and
localized water cold trapping. However, two-dimensional models, such as
that used by Siili et al., are inherently of limited utility for
modeling transport due to their inability to treat the true
three-dimensional complexity of atmospheric mixing processes (which are
of crucial importance even in the global models). We have adapted a
fully three-dimensional mesoscale model to examine Martian polar water
transport. The model and conversion are described by Toigo and
Richardson. The model is based on the Pennsylvania State
University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) Mesoscale
Model version five (MM5) and is fully adapted to Mars. The northern
polar cap is represented by Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter topography, and
Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper albedo and thermal inertia as reprocessed
by Vasavada et al. Water ice is prescribed to exist everywhere that the
albedo is above a value of 0.4. Exchange of water between the surface
and atmosphere is parameterized using the surface flux scheme. Water
transport in the atmosphere is implemented using the MM5 advection and
diffusion schemes. Exchange of water between the vapor and ice phases in
the atmosphere is implemented assuming instantaneous conversion at
saturation to and from fixed ice particle sizes. More detailed
microphysics may be implemented in the near future. Boundary and initial
conditions for the simulations, including the spatial varying fields of
atmospheric dust and water are derived from General Circulation Model
(GCM) simulations with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)
Mars GCM. We will present results comparing the transport fluxes of
water between the northern polar- and mid-latitudes as simulated by the
Mars MM5 and Mars GCM. We will describe the dominant modes of
atmospheric transport, and comment on the implications for the water
cycle control picture described by Richardson and Wilson.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Mars Exploration Program represents an unprecedented opportunity to study and explore a planet and an environment beyond our own. While this opportunity represents the most important development in planetary exploration since the initial robotic survey of the Solar System, it presents organizational and architectural challenges that have simply not been faced in the NASA robotic exploration endeavor to date. These challenges, of flying frequent, probably interrelated, missions to Mars within a moderate, flat fiscal environment, were responded to in the late 1990's by the Mars Surveyor Program. The architecture that evolved within this program became singularly motivated by the search for life and singularly focused upon a sample return mission (to be executed over many opportunities). The strategy behind this architecture sought to provide a clear rationale, develop common engineering systems, and centrally execute an ambitious technical program. We argue that the singular focus on the search for life and on the highly ambitious sample return strategy, while well motivated in terms of developing program coherence, forced the program into a non-optimal architecture and caused it to over-reach its means. We will argue that the focused and centralized nature of the program seriously limited its ability to respond to failures or successes; overly strained the program by coupling broad constituencies with a highly ambitious technical approach, and ultimately stifled competition, creativity, and responsiveness as the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) system was abandoned in favor of facility development. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The high-level scientific goals and themes of the Mars Exploration Program place important requirements on the nature and architecture of the program. Choices at this level impact not only the particular sequence of missions to be flown, but also the program's saleability, the extent to which the planetary science community is engaged in the program, and the ultimate value of the program both to our understanding of Mars and as a survey tool for deciding whether humans should venture there. We briefly review the history of scientific interest in Mars, through to the inception of the Mars Surveyor Program (MSP). While the MSP began as a relatively broad-based investigation of Mars, the excitement surrounding the 'discovery' of life in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001 redirected the program onto a pathway almost singularly focused on searching for fossil (or even extent) life in returned samples. We support the notion that the question of life is the single most important theme in Martian exploration. However, we argue that the approach that has evolved in the MSP--and would govern missions to be flown beyond 2001--is overly focused. This threatens the utility of the program as a means of understanding the cause and context of life's absence or presence. The rush to a yes-or-no answer on life has also placed technical strain on the program, will ultimately disenfranchise a significant fraction of the scientific community, and will seriously limit the ability of the program to 'survey' the planet for future exploration.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>In spite of recent failures, the prospects for Mars exploration remain excellent. The motivation for such optimism is, ironically, rooted in cyclical constraints that are unique to this endeavor: (1) steady annual funding of about 200 million; (2) regular launch opportunities every 26 months; (3) four to six years for the entire spacecraft development process; and (4) six to eight years for the science to unfold through instrument conception and design, and then converge through analysis and publication. These stable cycles create an important opportunity to employ an intelligent exploration strategy that is based on interactive adaptation, using past triumphs and failures to shape future missions. This stability, however, also poses a dangerous temptation to take the opposite approach: a static exploration strategy that is focused on a limited let of scientific objectives. Such an approach must, necessarily, rely on a single overarching 'best guess' as to exactly which fixed sequence of missions is the most attractive, based on a host of assumptions about the cost, technical risk, and potential scientific benefits of the options considered. This approach, however, is fundamentally flawed, even when implemented perfectly, because it does not allow lessons learned over time from both successes and failures to be incorporated into subsequent missions. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper 15-μm channel brightness temperature observations (IRTM T15) provide extensive spatial and temporal coverage of Martian atmospheric temperatures on diurnal to seasonal time scales. The 15-μm channel was designed so that these temperatures would be representative of a deep layer of atmosphere centered at 0.5 mb (≡25 km). A re-examination of the IRTM data indicates that the 15-μm channel was additionally sensitive to surface radiance so that air temperature determinations (nominal T15) are significantly biased when the thermal contrast between the surface and atmosphere is large. This bias is suggested by the strong correlation between the diurnal variation of tropical T15 and surface temperatures for non-dust-storm conditions. The authors show that numerical modeling of the thermal tides provides a basis for distinguishing between the surface and atmospheric contributions to IRTM T15 and thus allows the atmospheric component to be estimated. The resulting bias amounts to a ≡15-K offset for midday atmospheric temperatures at subsolar latitudes during relatively clear periods and is negligible at night. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Reanalysis of Viking Lander (VL) visible and Viking Orbiter infrared optical depth measurements shows that the visible to infrared ratio of total extinction opacity varies with season. The ratio is near to its previously reported constant value, 2.5, during dust storm periods and higher during northern spring and summer. The increase in ratio is hypothesized to be due to seasonally varying water ice haze, which produces a higher optical depth in the visible than in the infrared. This differs significantly from previous analyses of VL visible opacities which have assumed that only dust contributes to the optical depth measured during the early afternoon. Consequently we suggest that the Martian atmosphere is clearer of dust, especially during northern spring and summer, than previously suggested based upon VL data. We find dust visible optical depths of 0.1-0.4 during the northern spring and summer seasons, compared to previous estimates of 0.4-0.6. We also find that water ice hazes can provide roughly 50% of the total visible opacity in these seasons. For southern spring and summer, dust optical depths are more variable, but generally &gt;=0.4, with water ice opacity &lt;=0.1. The data suggest water ice optical depths are slightly higher and peak earlier (Ls=80°-90°) at VL1 than at VL2 (Ls=115°-130°). We estimate average northern summer water (daytime minimum) ice masses to be roughly 0.1-0.5 precipitable microns, depending on the assumed particle size distribution and hence 1-5% of the total water column. The observation of significant and previously unrecognized amounts of water ice haze suggests a larger role for water in controlling atmospheric heating rates and the vertical distribution of dust and water vapor than has been widely accepted to date. </td>

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Data collected by the Viking mission to Mars resulted in a picture of the Martian climate which stood largely unmodified for over a decade. When a challenge did come in the mid-1990's it resulted from ground-based and HST observations which suggested lower global-average temperatures and dust opacities, and more atmospheric water ice than inferred from Viking. These observations prompted suggestions of climate change orders of magnitude larger and faster than anything contemplated for the Earth. A combination of new data from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and reanalysis of Viking-era data have resulted in a new picture of the Martian climate. It is now clear that no significant climate change has occurred and that the ``cooler and cloudier'' conditions observed in the 1990's for northern summer applied equally well to the Viking era. TES observations have provided detailed information on the cycle of air temperature and water ice clouds which support and extend the ground-based and HST observations. The disagreement with Viking observations has been found to result from faults in the Viking Orbiter Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) 15 μm channel, the lack of analysis of IRTM data applicable to water ice, and the misinterpretation of Viking Lander opacity measurements. The TES observations provide a rich data base which is now allowing a new picture of the Martian climate to be constructed in which water vapour and water ice clouds may play a significant role in modulating the annual cycles of dust and air temperature.
