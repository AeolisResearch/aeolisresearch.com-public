<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Aeolian features observed on the surface of Mars provide insight into
current, and potentially past, surface wind systems. In some cases the
features are clearly transient and related to the lifting and settling
of atmospheric dust. Other features, like dunefields, yardangs, and
ventifacts, are more persistent and likely require significant time to
form. In this study we analyze the observed directions of selected
aeolian features with the aid of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory Mars general circulation model (GCM). Initially, we examine
bright and dark streaks which have been observed to form in association
with global dust storms. The ability to match these features with Mars
GCM wind directions provides an important validation of the model. More
important, we are able to define best fit seasons and local times for
both types of features which provide the basis for extension and
modification of the Veverka et al. [1981] model of bright and dark dust
streak formation. In addition these best fit times correspond well with
the dark streak ``wind storm'' model of Magalh√£es and Young
[1995]. The primary focus of this paper is to provide constraints on the
range of mechanisms proposed to explain inconsistencies between current
wind direction patterns and long-term wind indicators (for example, the
misalignment of rock tail and ventifact orientations at the Mars
Pathfinder landing site). Specifically, we assess whether changes in
planetary obliquity, precession, or global dust opacity could
significantly alter patterns of surface wind directions. In all cases we
find the seasonal and annual average wind direction patterns to be
highly invariable. While changes in the dust loading (hence the
partitioning of solar absorption between the surface and atmosphere) and
in the surface latitude of maximum solstitial insolation cause the vigor
of the large-scale circulation to increase (especially the Hadley cell),
the spatial patterns of the surface wind orientations remain essentially
unchanged. In the case of perihelion during northern summer (opposite of
the current perihelion position), the northern summer Hadley cell
remains weaker than the southern summer cell despite the strengthened
heating in the northern hemisphere. Taken together, these results cast
significant doubt on orbital explanations for surface wind changes. It
is thus suggested that significant changes in topography (e.g., Tharsis
uplift, true polar wander) or climate (e.g., the existence of a
significantly thicker atmosphere or an ocean at some point in the past)
are more likely explanations for long-term wind indicators such as the
ventifact orientations at the Mars Pathfinder landing site.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Aeolian action is most likely the dominant geologic process currently
acting on the surface of Mars. Data recently acquired by the Mars Global
Surveyor have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail
the surface features produced by aeolian activity in the area of the
southern highlands west of the Hellas Basin. All available data sets
have been incorporated into a Graphical Information System (GIS) in
order to correlate aeolian features with data products from the Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (e.g., albedo, thermal inertia, and composition)
and from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (e.g., surface roughness, and
elevation). In addition, a mesoscale model (the Mars MM5) has been
applied over the study area to determine sand transport capacity and
dominant wind directions. We present results from Proctor Crater, a
large ( ~150~km diameter), prominent, and well-studied crater of the
southern highlands of Mars. In the eastern portion of Proctor Crater is
a dunefield that spans 60~x~35~km. It consists of what has been
traditionally thought of as large ( ~1~km spacing), dark transverse dune
ridges. Analysis of the GIS has led to numerous conclusions regarding
the dunes of Proctor Crater. Surficial mapping of dune crests has led to
the hypothesis that the dunes are not transverse (i.e., perpendicular to
the dominant dune-forming wind) but that instead they are longitudinal
(i.e., parallel to the resultant of multiple dune-forming winds).
Mesoscale modeling supports the existence of a complex wind regime that
affects the shape of the dunes and determines the state of activity of
sand saltation. Close inspection of high resolution images (from the
Narrow Angle camera on the Mars Orbiter Camera) reveals that the large
dark dunes are surrounded by smaller ( ~30~m spacing), higher albedo
duneforms with which they share a complex interaction. Compositional
analysis of Proctor Crater has determined that the dark dunes are
largely basaltic, more so than the basaltic highlands in which they are
located. Calculations of thermal properties have led to estimates of
average particle sizes and albedo values for both the dark and bright
dunes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of GIS analysis and
the importance of high resolution atmospheric modeling.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Over two years of Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) data and over a
year of Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) data
now provide the most solid basis for our knowledge of the contemporary
Martian climate. Both instruments observed Mars in the thermal infrared,
including bands diagnostic of atmospheric temperature (from the
15-micron CO2 band), atmospheric dust (from the 9-micron silicate
feature), and atmospheric water ice (at 11-microns). Although the styles
of data collection were quite different for the two instruments (MGS
provides regular data from a low circular orbit, while Viking provided a
wider range of local times and observation elevations; TES is a
spectrometer, while IRTM was a 6-channel radiometer), they provide by
far the strongest basis for reliable assessment of interannual climate
variability. Key to this reliability is the fact that the TES data can
be used to generate "equivalent" IRTM data by passing the IRTM spectral
response functions over the TES spectra. This allows truly direct
"apples-for-apples" comparison between the data sets, greatly reducing
the possibility of confusing observational and retrieval biases for true
variations in climate. For the retrieval of dust and water ice, we
employ the method originally developed by T.Z. Martin [Icarus, 1986],
while for air temperatures, we choose to compare the brightness
temperatures in the band defined by the well-known IRTM 15-micron
channel. We examine the likely biases in the IRTM 15-micron data, and
compare a suggested correction [Wilson and Richardson, Icarus, 2000]
with the TES observations. In discussing the interannual record of
climate, we will highlight the behavior of mid-level air temperatures,
the tropical cloud belt, and the variety of dust storms observed in both
data sets. Where appropriate, for illustrative purposes, we will compare
with results from GFDL Mars GCM.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Global models of the Martian water cycle suggest that exchange of water
with the northern residual ice cap is the key determinant of bulk
atmospheric humidity. Unfortunately, pre-MGS data on the behavior of
water in the northern summer polar atmosphere has been sparse, and
global climate models used to simulate the water cycle are known to
provide poor representation of atmospheric motions in the polar regions
(due to the longitude-convergence problem). Here, we present the first
study of water transport in the northern polar summer atmosphere using a
Mesoscale model (the Mars MM5), which does not suffer from the polar
defects evident in GCM's. We combine this analysis with newly processed
TES data on the distribution of water vapor.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Which components control the contemporary water cycle and what is the
nature of the control mechanisms? These questions are at the heart of
understanding how the Martian exchangeable water budget adjusts to
perturbations and changes in the climate system. Analysis of a water
cycle model embedded in the GFDL Mars GCM provides a paradigm for the
water cycle as a feedback system, providing information on the important
control points and response times. Much information on this system
derives from monitoring the evolution towards steady state--one that
resembles the observed water vapour and ice cloud distributions. The
most important exchange balance in the system is that between the
northern polar atmosphere and the rest of the planet. As the major net
source for water, the northern residual water ice cap is active during
summer, in the window of time between the sublimation and recondensation
of the seasonal CO2 cap. At this time, water is exported from the
northern polar atmosphere at a rate determined by the mixing capacity of
the atmosphere and the amount of water held in the polar atmosphere. The
latter is determined by the cap surface temperature. During the
remainder of the year, water is returned to the pole. This return flux
is determined by the atmospheric mixing capacity and the amount of water
vapour held in the tropical and winter extratropical atmosphere.
Steady-state is achieved when these fluxes balance. For a given climate
state (and a roughly repeatable annual cycle of mixing), the outflux and
influx of polar water are controlled by separate variables. Holding the
cap temperature constant, the outflux will remain constant. Any
perturbation to the global water budget will result in a change in the
return flux that tends to oppose the sense of the perturbation--the
perturbation will be damped. In the same way, a change in cap
temperature (e.g. associated with a change in albedo) will result in
changed water outflow. Again, this will tend to change the non-polar
water vapour budget and hence the polar water influx so as to develop a
new steady-state. It is important to note that only in this case is the
steady-state global humidity changed: a given cap temperature and
seasonal cycle of mixing capacity specifies a bulk steady-state
atmospheric humidity. In all cases, the regolith acts as a damper on the
system and adjusts to the global water distribution dictated ultimately
by the northern cap. The model also suggests fast adjustment times, on
order decades. A number of factors can affect atmospheric mixing
capacity. As climate forcing factors change (associated with obliquity
or greenhouse gas loading) the mixing capacity will change--an area for
future study. The current mixing capacity of the atmosphere is also
different from one that would obtain without atmospheric water
condensation and sedimentation. Model clouds play important roles in
returning water to the residual ice cap in northern summer, and
significantly altering interhemispheric transport from that which would
occur without clouds. As with previous studies, the southern polar cap
acts as a permanent sink for water. The model and resulting paradigm for
the water cycle can be used in very preliminary studies of past climate
states. Forcing the model with an obliquity of 45 deg., the seasonal
water ice caps become significantly more extended, reaching into the
summer hemisphere. In fact, the seasonal caps "overlap" in the northern
tropics, generating a year-round surface ice belt. Much work remains to
be done in understanding water ice transport and exchange processes
before models of paleoclimate can be of widespread utility--of which
analysis of data from MGS and future missions will be key.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>The Mars Exploration Rovers: A Meteorological Tale of Four Landing Sites
In order to support landing site selection for the Mars Exploration
Rovers (MER), due for launch in mid-2003, we have conducted mesoscale
simulations of the meteorology at four sites using the Mars MM5 [Toigo
and Richardson, 2001]. The simulations at the four diverse sites
highlight interesting dynamical phenomena related to convection and
topographic control of flow. The Hematite region (2S, 6W), sitting in
the cratered southern plains, shows a large scale diurnal cycle of winds
that are primarily tidal. Embedded within this flow during the daytime
hours of peak heating are convective motions displaying classic
hexagonal cellular behavior. The convection is initiated over locally
high topography, but becomes detached and migrates during the late
afternoon. The Gusev Crater site (15S, 175E) displays similar tidal and
cellular convective behavior to the Hematite site, but also begins to
show evidence for channeling of flow by Ma'adim Vallis. Persistent slope
flow is also observed into and out of the crater. The Eos Chasma (13S,
41W) and Melas Chasma (9S, 77W) sites are both within the Valles
Marineris system, with Eos Chasma being at the eastern end of the main
canyon system. Both sites show very strong channeling of flow, with
canyon floor flow in substantially different direction to that on the
surrounding plains. Significant flow into and out of the canyons is also
indicated in response to diurnal cycles of heating. Adding to the
effects of topography is the strong contrast in thermal inertia between
the canyon floor and the plains. In all cases, we gauge the predicted
wind speeds and vertical shears at the landing times and locations to be
quite modest, at the extreme not more than 10 m/s per km. Given the
interesting flow behavior in the canyon systems, we very much hope for
one of the rovers to explore the depths of Valles Marineris.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>A multiannual simulation of the current Martian climate has been carried
out with the GFDL Mars general circulation model (MGCM) that includes
atmospheric transport of dust and water, as well as microphysics and the
radiative effects of water ice clouds. Simulations show good agreement
with the recent water column retrievals from TES data. The apparent
differences with Viking observations suggest that the MAWD data were
biased by the shielding of water vapor absorption features by dust. The
North tropical maximum of water column observed by TES in the perihelion
season (South winter) is reproduced in the GCM simulations and coincides
with the downward branch of the Hadley cell. Its counterpart in the
aphelion season is missing because of the condensational cutoff of
atmospheric water in the tropical upward branch of the Hadley cell that
produces the aphelion season tropical cloud belt. A series of parametric
sensitivity tests carried out with the model shows that both the
seasonal trends and latitudinal gradients of water column are largely
controlled by the intensity of Hadley circulation. In particular, in the
aphelion season, a more intense circulation results in stronger
latitudinal gradients and shorter period of rapid water vapor release
from the North polar cap. By contrast, a weaker circulation results in
smoother latitudinal extent of atmospheric water. In the equinoctial
seasons when the circulation intensity is weakest, it remains
responsible for the appearance of the precursor maxima of water vapor in
the extratropics in the spring hemispheres. As the intensity of the
Hadley circulation is sensitive to the thermal state of the atmosphere,
the water cycle is, in part, controlled by the microphysical and
radiative properties of water ice clouds, with sensitivity of this
control channel being rather smooth. There is no evidence, however, that
the adsorbing capability of the regolith has an equally important
leverage on the Martian water cycle.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Mars is replete with hemispheric asymmetry. Within the climate system,
asymmetry is expressed by the presence of a permanent CO2 ice
cap in the south and a residual water ice cap in the north; a cool, long
northern summer and a warm, short southern summer; and, far more
vigourous atmospheric circulation during southern summer than during
northern summer. Geophysically, asymmetry is expressed by the large
difference ( 5 km) in the mean elevation of the much older southern
hemisphere and the younger north. It is generally accepted that the
primary cause of the climatic asymmetries is the relatively large
eccentricity of the Martian orbit (0.093) and the timing of perihelion
just before southern summer solstice. As the argument of perihelion
changes with time, it is expected that asymmetric biases in climate will
cycle between the hemispheres on time-scales of
105-106 years. In this presentation, we
demonstrate that a decidedly endogenic and non-time varying
characteristic of Mars - the offset in planetary centre-of-mass from
centre-of-figure - imparts a strong hemispherically asymmetric signature
on the climate. We show that the topographic dichotomy forces an
annual-average tropical circulation which is strongly biased towards the
southern summer solstice, winter hemisphere cell. This bias has
important implications for interhemispheric transport of water and
lifting of dust. We relate the circulation bias to model predictions
that in the absence of a residual CO2 ice cap, water ice
would be unstable at the southern pole. Hemispheric biases in the
atmospheric cycles of water ice and dust may be fundamentally linked to
the distribution of Martian volatiles.

<th>Abstract:</th>
<td>Aeolian action is most likely the dominant geologic process currently
acting on the surface of Mars. Data recently acquired by the Mars Global
Surveyor have provided an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail
the surface features produced by aeolian activity in the area of the
southern highlands west of the Hellas Basin. All available data sets
have been incorporated into a Graphical Information System (GIS) in
order to correlate aeolian features with data products from the Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (e.g., albedo, thermal inertia, and composition)
and from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (e.g., surface roughness and
elevation). In addition, a mesoscale model (the Mars MM5) has been
applied over the study area to determine sand transport capacity and
dominant wind directions. We present results from Proctor Crater, a
large ( ~150 km diameter), prominent, and well-studied crater of the
southern highlands of Mars. In the eastern portion of Proctor Crater is
a dunefield that spans 60 x 35 km. It consists of what has been
traditionally thought of as large ( ~1 km spacing), dark transverse dune
ridges. Analysis of the GIS has led to numerous conclusions regarding
the dunes of Proctor Crater. Surficial mapping of dune crests has led to
the hypothesis that the dunes are not transverse (i.e., perpendicular to
the dominant dune-forming wind) but that instead they are longitudinal
(i.e., parallel to the resultant of multiple dune-forming winds).
Mesoscale modeling supports the existence of a complex wind regime that
affects the shape of the dunes and determines the state of activity of
sand saltation. Close inspection of high resolution images (from the
Narrow Angle camera on the Mars Orbiter Camera) reveals that the large
dark dunes are surrounded by smaller ( ~30 m spacing), higher albedo
duneforms with which they share a complex interaction. Compositional
analysis of Proctor Crater has determined that the dark dunes are
largely basaltic, more so than the basaltic highlands in which they are
located. Calculations of thermal properties have led to estimates of
average particle sizes and albedo values for both the dark and bright
dunes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of GIS analysis and
the importance of high resolution atmospheric modeling. This work has
been supported by the Mars Data Analysis Program.
